    It is well recognized that models in the life sciences can be sensitive to
  small variations in their model functions, a phenomenon known as 'structural
  sensitivity'. Conventionally, modelers test for sensitivity by varying
  parameters for a specific formulation of the model functions, but models can
  show structural sensitivity to the choice of functional representations used:
  a particularly concerning problem when system processes are too complex, or
  insufficiently understood, to theoretically justify specific
  parameterizations. Here we propose a rigorous test for the detection of
  structural sensitivity in a system with respect to the local stability of
  equilibria, the main idea being to project infinite dimensional function
  space onto a finite dimensional space by considering the local properties of
  the model functions. As an illustrative example, we use our test to
  demonstrate structural sensitivity in the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur
  predator-prey model, and show that the conventional parameterbased approach
  can fail to do so. We also consider some implications that structural
  sensitivity has for ecological modelling: we argue that when the model
  exhibits structural sensitivity but experimental results remain consistent it
  may indicate that there is a problem with the model construction, and that in
  some cases trying to find an 'optimal' parameterization of a model function
  may simply be impossible when the model exhibits structural sensitivity.
  Finally, we suggest that the phenomenon of structural sensitivity in
  biological models may help explain the irregular oscillations often observed
  in real ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the

    * Preliminary read - The authors propose a test for evaluating structural
  sensitivity of the model. - I see this as potentially useful for discussing
  the "mechanistic pitfall". - I think other papers on the "mechanistic
  pitfall" are also good, such as Wood 2001, Jost and Ellner 2000, etc. * Notes
  - In the abstract the authors say that sensitivty should not only be
  performed on parameters, but also on model structure. And that this is often
  not done. - they define structural sensitivity as change in model behaviour
  with mathematical forumlation of the model. - They state that conventional
  model search in a subset of pre-defined parameters is subjective. - They
  state that generalising from well-observed populations (e.g. in the lab) to
  natural populations may not work. I see that they do not even question
  whether across the same replicates it may be possible. - They state that
  uncertainty arises because of experimental errors but also biological
  variation. Results can further vary because of model structural sensitivity.
  References 42-46 may be interesting for supporting that. - They state that
  functional relations between system component are not consistent in time, due
  to a change in unobserved variables (environment, internal state, evolution)
  which may require a change in the model structure. That is reminding me that
  no model should be fixed ideally, or at least complex enough to allow for
  change.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent investigations have shown that processes within the planktonic
  microbial web are of great significance for the functioning of limnetic
  ecosystems. However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as
  food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has
  seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the
  food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic
  flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most
  rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of
  heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have
  indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria
  consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according
  to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient
  predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even
  nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and
  chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively
  low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and
  protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to
  suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it.
  Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant
  feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates,
  small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids)
  seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another
  important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web.
  Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web
  and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary
  for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems.

    Adaptive variation in the traits determining ecological interactions can
  lead to evolution so rapid that ecological dynamics change course while in
  progress (i.e., 'eco-evolutionary dynamics'). However, little is known about
  how the qualitative properties of eco-evolutionary dynamics (e.g., cycling,
  equilibrium, etc.) are affected by the amount of heritable variation present.
  Here, we show that a change in the range of variation in a heritable prey
  defense trait determines what dynamics are observed in an experimental
  predator-prey system. We combine modelling and laboratory experiments to show
  that initial defense trait variation determines whether populations exhibit
  eco-evolutionary cycles in which heritable variation is maintained, or
  converge to an equilibrium at which the prey population becomes monomorphic.
  Our results show how small changes in the amount of adaptive genetic variance
  initially present can radically alter eco-evolutionary dynamics, and can
  ultimately determine whether heritable variation is maintained or lost.%

    Takeaway - Paper shows that the amount of initial genetic architecture
  constrains the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the system. Namely, different

    Feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary change may play important
  roles in community and ecosystem functioning, but a complete eco-evolutionary
  feedback loop has not been demonstrated at the community level, and we know
  little about molecular mechanisms underlying this kind of eco-evolutionary
  dynamics. In predator-prey (rotifer-alga) microcosms, cyclical changes in
  predator abundance generated fluctuating selection for a heritable prey
  defence trait, cell clumping. Predator population growth was affected more by
  prey evolution than by changes in prey abundance, and changes in predator
  abundance drove further prey evolution, completing the feedback loop. Within
  a predator-prey cycle, genes up-regulated as clumping declined were
  down-regulated as clumping increased, and vice-versa. Genes changing most in
  expression tended to be associated with defence or its cost. Expression
  patterns of individual genes differed greatly between consecutive cycles
  (often reversing direction), suggesting that a particular phenotype may be
  produced by several (perhaps many) different gene transcription pathways.%

    Takeaway - "direct" evidence for feedback effects. Clumb size affects the
  growth rate of the predator. The predator density affect the growth rate of
  the prey (not demonstrated in the study though). - They show that the pattern
  of gene expression varies across cycles. This means that the dynamics of the
  traits are governed by highly complex genetic pathways, which are
  inconsistent in time. Note - I still see that as qualitative evidence. The
  complete feedback is not demonstrated. - Might be a good paper to use in your
  introduction as an example of eco-evo feedback. - This article makes me think
  that redundancy in the pathways for phenotypic change may be one mechanism to
  maintain genetic variation. 1. Introduction - Genomics + observing fast
  evolution => set the possibility to dissect microscopic structure of
  evolution with ecological time series. 2. Methods - Experimental microcosm in
  lab (rotifer algal system). - Trait is algae clumping up to resist predators,
  but reduce amount of nitrogen they receive individually. - Monitor
  populations densities, and expression of annotated gene sequences +
  correlation with trait expression. - Evolution (trait change) contributes to
  ecological dynamics. 3. Results - Theoretical predictions match observed
  dynamics in the lab. - Gene expression underlying phenotype expression
  changes from one cycle to the next despite same trait and population
  dynamics... 4. Discussion - although genetic structure is identified, gene
  expression changes in opposite manner from one cycle to the next. - Could be
  due to changes in allele densities, and/or, changes in expression level of
  regulatory elements. - Should be more complex in nature... need to understand
  under what circumstances eco-evo feedbacks arise. 5. Comments: - would be a
  nice data set to test models on. - shows that genotype phenotype map may
  change... => (i) reinforces the need for controlling eco-evo dynamics when
  studying genotype phenotype maps. => (ii) scary because means that the
  genetic architecture of eco-evo feedbacks may change on the fly.%

    It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic
  levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels,
  experience higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear
  whether this prediction is consistent with the effect of warming on the
  trophic structure of natural systems. Furthermore, effects of temperature at
  the species level, which arise through a change in species composition, may
  differ from those at the population level, which arise through a change in
  population structure. We investigate this by building species-level trophic
  networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy for population
  structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual fish
  samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We
  estimated effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of
  nodes), vertical trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and
  distribution of biomass across trophic level (correlation between trophic
  level and biomass) in these networks. We found a positive effect of
  temperature on total trophic diversity in both species- and size-structured
  trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass
  distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks,
  but the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic
  networks. These results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower
  vertical trophic diversity in size-structured networks, and a higher one in
  species-level networks. This suggests that vertical trophic diversity is
  shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature on population structure and on
  species composition. Our results hence demonstrate that effects of
  temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across levels
  of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying
  complex changes in network structure and functioning with warming.%

    Long-term studies of two-species interactions under field conditions are
  unusual; most long-term field studies are of single species dynamics (1-6).
  Concurrent long-term studies on the dynamics of the same two interacting
  species in different locations are very rare. This result has led to the
  tacit assumption that diffehjkrent cases of the same two-species interaction
  would involve essentially quantitative differences (e.g., context-specific
  differences in the numeric values of demographic parameters like fecundity or
  death rates). Here, we show that for one of the best-known two-species
  systems (ragwort and cinnabar moth), this finding does not hold. The
  interaction between the plant and its herbivore is fundamentally different in
  coastal dunes in The Netherlands and in grasslands in Southeast England. In
  the first case, the dynamics are cyclic and the interaction involves both
  direct and delayed density dependence; in the second case, the insect has
  little impact on plant dynamics and there are no time lags in density
  dependence. The difference is caused by differences in the importance of
  seed-limitation in plant recruitment in the two locations.%

    1. Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and
  ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that
  is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which
  vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population
  trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary
  dynamics. 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic
  rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished
  stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and
  uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as
  well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment
  performed in a glasshouse. 3. Using data on changes in population abundance
  and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with
  inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit
  across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific
  caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the
  model on survival, growth and reproduction. 4. Results suggest that clones
  varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction
  and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative
  density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of
  predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while
  survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth
  rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation
  based on the pure clones. 5. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much
  vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition
  analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving
  populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed
  an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss
  that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of
  individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and
  limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach. K E Y W O R D S

    While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the
  solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the
  selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much
  less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation
  procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efficiently in closed
  form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient
  means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of
  performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are
  therefore prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use
  of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a
  replarisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior
  over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation
  parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of
  thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the
  benefit of this approach.%

    Summary 1. Predicting competitive outcomes in communities frequently
  involves inferences based on deterministic population models since these
  provide clear criteria for exclusion (e.g., R* rule) or long-term coexistence
  (e.g., mutual invasibility). 2. However, incorporating stochasticity into
  population- or community-level processes into models is necessary if the goal
  is to explain variation in natural systems, which are inherently stochastic.
  3. Similarly, in systems with demographic or environmental stochasticity,
  weaker competitors have the potential to exclude superior competitors,
  contributing to what is known as 'competitive indeterminancy'. The importance
  of such effects for natural communities is unknown, in part because it is
  difficult to demonstrate that multiple forms of stochasticity are present in
  these communities. Moreover, the effects of multiple forms of stochasticity
  on competitive outcomes are largely untested, even in theory. 4. Here, we
  address these issues by examining the role of stochasticity in replicated
  communities of flour beetles (Tribolium sp.). To do so, we developed a set of
  two-species stochastic Ricker models incorporating four distinct forms of
  stochasticity: environmental stochasticity, demographic stochasticity,
  demographic heterogeneity, and stochastic sex determination. 5. By fitting
  models to experimental data, and simulating fit models to examine long term
  behavior, we found that both the duration of tranisent coexistence and the
  degree of competitive indeterminacy were sensitive to the forms of
  stochasticity included in our models. These findings suggest current
  estimates of extinction risk, coexistence, and time until competitive
  exclusion in communities may not be accurate when based on models that
  exclude relevant forms of stochasticity.%

    Abstract The field of eco-evolutionary dynamics is developing rapidly, with
  a growing number of well-designed experiments quantifying the impact of
  evolution on ecological processes and patterns, ranging from population
  demography to community composition and ecosystem functioning. The key
  challenge remains to transfer the insights of these proof-of-principle
  experiments to natural settings, where multiple species interact and the
  dynamics are far more complex than those studied in most experiments. Here,
  we discuss potential pitfalls of building a framework on eco-evolutionary
  dynamics that is based on data on single species studied in isolation from
  interspecific interactions, which can lead to both under- and overestimation
  of the impact of evolution on ecological processes. Underestimation of
  evolution-driven ecological changes could occur in a single-species approach
  when the focal species is involved in co-evolutionary dynamics, whereas
  overestimation might occur due to increased rates of evolution following
  ecological release of the focal species. In order to develop a multi-species
  perspective on eco-evolutionary dynamics, we discuss the need for a
  broad-sense definition of ?eco-evolutionary feedbacks? that includes any
  reciprocal interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes, next to
  a narrow-sense definition that refers to interactions that directly feed back
  on the interactor that evolves. We discuss the challenges and opportunities
  of using more natural settings in eco-evolutionary studies by gradually
  adding complexity: (a) multiple interacting species within a guild, (b) food
  web interactions and (c) evolving metacommunities in multiple habitat patches
  in a landscape. A literature survey indicated that only a few studies on
  microbial systems so far developed a truly multi-species approach in their
  analysis of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and mostly so in artificially
  constructed communities. Finally, we provide a road map of methods to study
  eco-evolutionary dynamics in more natural settings. Eco-evolutionary studies
  involving multiple species are necessarily demanding and might require
  intensive collaboration among research teams, but are highly needed. A plain
  language summary is available for this article.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Population dynamic modelling often entails parameterizing quite
  sophisticated biological and ecological mechanisms. For models of moderate
  mechanistic complexity, this has traditionally been done in an ad hoc manner,
  with different parameters being estimated independently. The point estimates
  so obtained are then used for model simulation, perhaps with some further ad
  hoc adjustment based on comparison with any available data on population
  dynamics. Quantitative assessments of model adequacy and prediction
  uncertainty are not easily made using this approach. As an alternative, the
  paper investigates the practical feasibility of fitting a moderately complex
  population dynamic model directly and simultaneously to all the data
  available for parameterization of the model, and to all available data on the
  population dynamics of the target animal. This alternative approach allows us
  to combine all available quantitative information on the target species, to
  assess the viability of the model, the mutual consistency of model and
  different sources of data and to estimate the uncertainties that are
  associated with model-based predictions. The target organism in this study is
  the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex (L.), which we model using a
  stage-structured population dynamic model, implemented via a set of delay
  differential equations describing the basic demography of the population.
  Target data include population dynamic data from two sites, information on
  basic physiological relationships and environmental temperature data. Fitting
  is performed by using a non-linear least squares approach supplemented with a
  bootstrapping method for avoiding small scale local minima in the least
  squares objective function. Variance estimation is performed by further
  bootstrapping. Interest in Gammarus pulex population dynamics in this case is
  primarily related to likely population level responses to chemical stressors,
  and for this we examine predicted 'recovery times' following exposure to a
  known toxicant. {\textcopyright} 2006 Royal Statistical Society.%

    * Perliminary read - This looks interesting as they seem to be fitting a

  that fitting to the complete dataset makes parameters more identifiable, and
  that the traditional approach increases the range of possibilities by
  ignoring inter-dependences between parameters. - They still highlight
  problems with underfitting and overfitting some time series which is due to
  making a compromise between the two locations. I see that as a problem
  because you do not accurately describe the dynamics of each system well
  then... One possible reason is precisely because generalisation is not
  possible. - In the end the paper might be useful to show that fitting
  globally across replicates may not lead to optimal results because
  generalisation is tricky in natural populations. You can hence use it as an
  example of non-generalisation.%

    Decomposing variation in population growth into contributions from both
  ecological and evolutionary processes is of fundamental concern, particularly
  in a world characterized by rapid responses to anthropogenic threats.
  Although the impact of ecological change on evolutionary response has long
  been acknowledged, the converse has predominantly been neglected, especially
  empirically. By applying a recently published conceptual framework, we assess
  and contrast the relative importance of phenotypic and environmental
  variability on annual population growth in five ungulate populations. In four
  of the five populations, the contribution of phenotypic variability was
  greater than the contribution of environmental variability, although not
  significantly so. The similarity in the contributions of environment and
  phenotype suggests that neither is worthy of neglect. Population growth is a
  consequence of multiple processes, which strengthens arguments advocating
  integrated approaches to assess how populations respond to their
  environments. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.%

    Demographic stochasticity is almost universally modeled as sampling
  variance in a homogeneous population, although it is defined as arising from
  random variation among individuals. This can lead to serious misestimation of
  the extinction risk in small populations. Here, we derive analytical
  expressions showing that the misestimation for each demographic parameter is
  exactly (in the case of survival) or approximately (in the case of fecundity)
  proportional to the among-individual variance in that parameter. We also show
  why this misestimation depends on systematic variation among individuals,
  rather than random variation. These results indicate that correctly assessing
  the importance of demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the
  variance in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative
  shape (convex or concave) of the mean-variance relationship; and (3)
  information on the mechanisms generating among-individual variation. An
  important consequence is that almost all population viability analyses (PVAs)
  overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity and, therefore, the
  risk of extinction.%

    Biologists use mathematical functions to model, understand and predict
  nature. For most biological processes, however, the exact analytical form is
  not known. This is also true for one of the most basic life processes: the
  uptake of food or resources. We show that the use of several nearly
  indistinguishable functions, which can serve as phenomenological descriptors
  of resource uptake, may lead to alarmingly different dynamical behaviour in a

    Understanding species coexistence has long been a major goal of ecology.
  Coexistence theory for two competing species posits that intraspecific
  density dependence should be stronger than interspecific density dependence.
  Great tits and blue tits are two bird species that compete for food resources
  and nesting cavities. On the basis of long-term monitoring of these two
  competing species at sites across Europe, combining observational and
  manipulative approaches, we show that the strength of density regulation is
  similar for both species, and that individuals have contrasting abilities to
  compete depending on their age. For great tits, density regulation is driven
  mainly by intraspecific competition. In contrast, for blue tits,
  interspecific competition contributes as much as intraspecific competition,
  consistent with asymmetric competition between the two species. In addition,
  including age-specific effects of intra- and interspecific competition in
  density-dependence models improves predictions of fluctuations in population
  size by up to three times.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these
  data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates,
  mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information
  from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating
  fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to
  re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved
  vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by
  replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating
  population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates
  change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data
  that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population
  dynamics. Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea
  aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are
  consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this
  regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the
  role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling
  methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid
  dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions
  about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We
  find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate
  substantially, declines in aphid population growth rates do not coincide with
  increases in parasitism. Therefore, parasitism cannot be responsible for the
  density-dependent regulation of aphid populations observed in the field.

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important
  phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the
  outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of
  this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
  dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have
  evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the
  overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that
  ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential
  to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution
  be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
  impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a
  framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven
  by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary
  factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental
  change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its
  contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
  other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a
  theoretical predator– prey interaction [Abrams, P. & Matsuda, H. (1997).
  Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey
  evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal
  ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these
  contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets
  for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets
  relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as
  character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For
  Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. &
  Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
  has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a
  population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to
  fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr & Dillon, T.A. (1990).
  Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one
  quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but
  nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to
  understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to
  consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation
  are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.%

    - Elegant framework - quite simple - they use the chain rule to compute
  contirbutions of times series on each other. They apply it to concrete
  empirical evidence of feedbacks by discretizing the framework. The interest
  of discretizing the method, is that it frees them from the need to identify
  equations, and thus a mechanisms. They can test directly the interdependences
  between the time series. - They apply it to real system in a discrete
  fashion, which complicates the maths and thus the applicability of the

    - Only if you need an example of dynamics from which to infer trophic
  interactions. * Notes - The author adress how intraguild predation affects
  prey-predator cycles. - They claim that they demonstrate dynamics that are in
  accordance with theory algae -> flagellate -> rotifer. But they state that
  flagellate growth rate is primarily driven by rotifers, rather than by algae.
  - I can use this paper to justify using a three-species trophic network,
  because it is a fundamental component of natural food webs. - The author
  state that there are few empirical demonstrations of population dynamics for
  three-species systems. I deduce from it that at that point, it was not even
  possible to assess generalisation. - Flagellates did tend to go extinct, so
  they pumped them artificially at around 4 % pday. - The authors state that
  they reported only runs with no evidence of prey defense evolution, but that
  evolution was common in their runs. - Looking at their equations I realised I
  did not consider the possibility for fluctuations in resource availability.
  This is one of the hidden variables. I will need to think about that. -
  Overall, they state that results are "exactly" as predicted. I would argue
  that qualitatively this is seems correct but quantitatively the story may be
  different. - They state that the peak of flagellate being so close to the
  algae can be due to a strong dominant drive by the rotifer population, though
  they only hypothesise that. This seems to be the case in other
  microzooplankton systems. Your results confirm this and potentially increase
  the complexity of the interactions. - They still argue that prey evolution
  played at best a minor role in explaining the dynamics. However, they do
  admit that they did not have direct evidence for supporting constant
  interaction strength. I can that being useful in your paper which seems to
  point in fact at quite important implications for evolution in explaining
  differences across replicates and preventing generalisation.%

    Many time series are effectively generated by a combination of
  deterministic continuous flows along with discrete jumps sparked by
  stochastic events. However, we usually do not have the equation of motion
  describing the flows, or how they are affected by jumps. To this end, we
  introduce Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations that provide a
  data-driven approach to learn continuous and discrete dynamic behavior, i.e.,
  hybrid systems that both flow and jump. Our approach extends the framework of
  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with a stochastic process term that
  models discrete events. We then model temporal point processes with a
  piecewise-continuous latent trajectory, where the discontinuities are caused
  by stochastic events whose conditional intensity depends on the latent state.
  We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our model on a range of
  synthetic and real-world marked point process datasets, including classical
  point processes (such as Hawkes processes), awards on Stack Overflow, medical
  records, and earthquake monitoring.%

    The functional response is a key element in all predator-prey interactions.
  Although functional responses are traditionally modelled as being a function
  of prey density only, evidence is accumulating that predator density also has
  an important effect. However, much of the evidence comes from artificial
  experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the
  natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in
  particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional
  response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations by
  reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey
  time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey
  interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the
  functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include
  time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these
  delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the
  non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and
  suggest that a modified version of the Hassell-Varley predator interference
  model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation
  and applied modelling.%

  is a bummer. Overall the method looks quite complicated due to the use of
  splines. They also ran into problems comparing non parametric model

    The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic
  example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for populations that
  exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological
  mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but
  despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite
  conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three
  hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality
  (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids
  (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids); and (3) maternal effects
  (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the
  empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis
  in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting
  approach to fit each model to three long-term population time series in
  Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric
  bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their
  goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at
  Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at
  Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and
  at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism
  models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1
  during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have
  been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the
  observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of
  empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though
  allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any
  location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The
  maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the
  constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at
  two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the
  remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal
  effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong
  biological and dynamical evidence. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological

  essential for many purposes. The Bayesian framework provides a principled
  approach to this, however applying it to NNs is challenging due to large
  numbers of parameters and data. Ensembling NNs provides an easily
  implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it
  has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one
  modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate
  Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a
  distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of
  the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is
  centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and
  overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact
  recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs.
  Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard
  ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.%

    Abstract Statistical techniques exist for inferring community assembly
  processes from community patterns. Habitat filtering, competition, and
  biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in
  phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference
  techniques is, however, debated as a mechanistic and causal link between
  process and pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes and trophic
  interactions are ignored. Here, we revisit the current knowledge on community
  assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews that have outlined
  challenges associated with current inference techniques, we identify a
  discrepancy between the current paradigm of eco-evolutionary community
  assembly and current inference techniques that focus mainly on competition
  and habitat filtering. We argue that trait-based dynamic eco-evolutionary
  models in combination with recently developed model fitting and model
  evaluation techniques can provide avenues for more accurate, reliable, and
  inclusive inference. To exemplify, we implement a trait-based, spatially
  explicit eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification,
  fitting, and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from
  diverse data sources. Through a case study on inference of prey and predator
  niche width in an eco-evolutionary context, we demonstrate how inclusive and
  mechanistic approaches?eco-evolutionary modelling and Approximate Bayesian
  Computation (ABC)?can enable inference of assembly processes that have been
  largely neglected by traditional techniques despite the ubiquity of such
  processes. Much literature points to the limitations of current inference
  techniques, but concrete solutions to such limitations are few. Many of the
  challenges associated with novel inference techniques are, however, already
  to some extent resolved in other fields and thus ready to be put into action
  in a more formal way for inferring processes of community assembly from
  signals in various data sources.%

    Summary - they build an eco-evo patch-based and trait-based ODE model were
  dispersion on the phenotypic space is modelled by a mutation kernel. - They
  simulate the model from priors over a given time period and compare model
  outcome to observations. Through an rejection scheme they retain only the
  best solutions, which gives parameter estimations. Notes - the authors state
  that there is a need for inferring processes from observations, given that
  not every processes can be accounted for in experiments due to the complexity
  of natural systems. - I see that this paper calls for inference technique
  that rely on a more mechanistic modelling of the dynamics of ecosystem
  comunities. - The author states that identifying processes in communities is
  complicated because there are multiple processes that can produce the same
  patterns, and often these processes do interplay. - Authors state that
  community dynmaics rarely consider both spatial and temporal dynamics,
  trophic interactions, and evolution. - they state the approach should be
  accompanied by model selection => I see that as a potential limit to the
  framework given the complexity of the processes considered. - Though their
  data was simulated on 5000 evolutionary steps, they do not mention how long
  was the predictive model simulated for. It is hence unclear how that would be
  overcome in practice. - I think the statistical scheme is interesting in the
  context of your NODE paper. You could invoke the ABC rejection principle to
  justify the recovery of approximate posterior distribution of the parameters.
  However, you would still need the optimisation step otherwise the fit would
  be crap. - On this last note, I think this approach is only suitable for very
  well specified models in well known systems. Indeed they only simulate from
  priors, if they infer only two parameters there is a good chance they would
  sample accidentally a good scenario, this become virtually impossible for
  higher dimensional models. Hence, you would need at least an optimisation
  step. But I guess this would work for "simple" model, or for really not
  greedy "inferences" (i.e. getting at only a few parameters). - There is alot
  of shadows surrounding the choice of initial conditions, time period on which
  to run the model, as this is likely to affect the model output as much if not
  more than parameter specifications. For instance for the same parameters, if
  you simulate the model for a short amount of time you would obtain an output
  close to initial conditions, if you simulate the model for a really long time
  you will get something different. - What about model stochasticity? I guess
  this is accounted for in the ABC rejection scheme.%

    Potential community effects of nutrient enhancement are a topic of
  theoretical interest and increasing management concern in coastal marine
  systems. While increased nutrient levels may lead to increased microalgal
  production and biomass, studies have provided variable evidence regarding the
  existence of upward cascade effects on macrofauna. In benthic marine
  communities, limitation by predation or factors preventing recruitment
  response may contribute to weak coupling between resource availability and
  macrobenthos abundances. We conducted blocked nutrient addition and predator
  exclusion experiments in the intertidal of two estuaries that varied in
  background nutrient concentrations (Cape Fear and White Oak, southeastern
  North Carolina). Benthic community comparisons were also made among these and
  two other North Carolina estuaries to examine correlations in distribution
  patterns. Cape Fear, which had the highest background nitrogen and phosphorus
  concentrations, also had highest ambient benthic microalgal biomass. There
  was no significant response of microalgal biomass to local nutrient additions
  in Cape Fear and only one macrofaunal taxon during one season exhibited
  abundance responses to nutrient additions. White Oak, with lower background
  nutrient levels, was characterized by significant microalgal responses to
  nutrient additions and significant macrofauna abundance responses for 50% of
  the species examined during summer experiments. However, all of these
  macrofauna declined in abundance with nutrient enhancement while biomass
  remained constant or significantly increased with nutrient additions. This
  suggests a complex response of macrofauna to nutrient additions in this
  estuary with greater biomass per individual but a corresponding decline in
  abundances. Top-down/bottom-up interactive effects were observed for
  haustoriid amphipods, which were uncommon or absent when predators had
  access, but exhibited strong biomass responses to nutrient enhancement when
  predators were excluded. These results support a growing body of literature
  that indicates the importance of background conditions in regulating benthic
  community responses to nutrient enhancement. However, responses may be
  complex with biomass per individual rather than densities being the primary
  response variable for some taxa and predator moderation of responses
  occurring for some taxa but not others. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

    Species in a common landscape often face similar selective environments.
  The capacity of organisms to adapt to these environments may be largely
  species specific. Quantifying shared and unique adaptive responses across
  species within landscapes may thus improve our understanding of
  landscape-moderated biodiversity patterns. Here we test to what extent
  populations of two coexisting and phylogenetically related
  fishes—three-spined and nine-spined stickleback—differ in the strength
  and nature of neutral and adaptive divergence along a salinity gradient.
  Phenotypic differentiation, neutral genetic differentiation and genomic
  signatures of adaptation are stronger in the three-spined stickleback. Yet,
  both species show substantial phenotypic parallelism. In contrast, genomic
  signatures of adaptation involve different genomic regions, and are thus
  non-parallel. The relative contribution of spatial and environmental drivers
  of population divergence in each species reflects different strategies for
  persistence in the same landscape. These results provide insight in the
  mechanisms underlying variation in evolutionary versatility and ecological
  success among species within landscapes.%

    Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are
  highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are
  valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying
  processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and
  experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract
  from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter
  measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones
  delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different
  settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the
  properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary
  considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations.
  In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model
  parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We
  combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model
  with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for
  variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a
  comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that
  features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model
  predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of
  the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the
  Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting
  cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process
  rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We
  detected significant variability among parameters of different time series
  and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a
  source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending
  more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and
  shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by
  simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in
  conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal
  properties in nature.%

    From Duplicate 2 (Estimating parameters from multiple time series of
  population dynamics using bayesian inference - Rosenbaum, Benjamin; Raatz,
  Michael; Weithoff, Guntram; Fussmann, Gregor F.; Gaedke, Ursula) Takeaway: -
  the authors examplify the use of Bayesian ODE fitting to time series to
  recover ecological parameters of interest in a prey-predator chemostat
  system. Notes: - The author state that they rely on HMC to fit their models
  while mentionning that the likelihood is evaluated numerically. I see that as
  a big problem and one that is not reasurring when it comes to the reliability
  of the work. - The author use a hierarchical model to fit the model to
  different time series. I find this quite elegant. - I find that the model fit
  are rubbish, which is a second point that advise caution. - I realise that
  this is not completely novel, there have been applications of the method
  recently, it exists in other fields, the authors barely acknowledge this. -
  The author fitted a deterministic ODE model to 18 different time series of
  the same system. They found variation in the vital rates across time series.
  They however only briefly conclude that it may be due to differences in
  phenotpyic structure of populations. Not more. - There are several key
  differences with your work on rotifer (1) the time series display more
  variations in dynamics, potentially in line with the fact that they did not
  use very similar populations (experiment performed over 7 years!), so not
  really true replicates in this sense, rather different populations; (2) they
  use only 2 species ; (3) they use a single parametric model, the fit of which
  is not even that good, which may be biasing a lot the results (dixit
  structural sensitivity), your approaches is non parametric and therefore
  better in this case ; (4) they do not really discuss that - You can
  potentially position yourself by stating that this is close to a replicated
  system but not completely, what about populations that are actually almost
  identical? - It seems that the time series come from different experiments,
  so technically not really replicates and differences in dynamics and
  dynamical processes are expected. The origin and differences among these time
  series is unclear and we cannot draw conclusions regarding the source of
  variability in dynamical processes. This is however a very interesting
  stepping stone to jump from.%

    1. The effects of global and local environmental changes are transmitted
  through networks of interacting organisms to shape the structure of
  communities and the dynamics of ecosystems. 2. We tested the impact of
  elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring
  experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months.
  Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of
  planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. 3. We
  found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower
  biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton,
  zoobenthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication
  increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading
  positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced
  biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the
  presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of
  top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of
  eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of
  fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased
  whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the
  distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and
  benthos, and microbes and macrobes. 4. Our results indicate that warming
  exerts a host of indirect effects on aquatic food webs mediated through
  shifts in the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up forcing.%

  Need to improve our ability to forecast the state of our ecosystems. - Direct
  + indirect effects of temperature. - Freshwater systems particularly impacted
  by warming (check article for list of factors). - Temperature disrupts
  trophic interactions (top-down and bottom-up control). - T -> affects body
  size. @ Reasons why effects of T are potentially unpredictable - In
  freshwater systems pellagic and benthic are different, and interconnected. No
  classic size structure in benthic trophic interactions. => disrupt effects of
  T on the whole food web. - Indirect effects of T on microbial community
  unknown. 2. M&M - Mesocosm experiment in tanks. - Microbial communities +
  periphyton + phytoplankton + zooplankton + invertebrates. - Treatments:
  warming (control, + 3 degrees); nutrients (control, enriched); fishes
  (control, addition of 5 sticklebacks = top predator). - 16 months + sampling
  on regular basis. - Measure biomass. 3. Results - Warming and nutrients
  amplified effects of fish. - Fish produce bottom heavy food webs (boosts
  periphyton, etc.). - Warming reduces phytopl biomass. 4. Discussion - Effect
  of temperature depend on food web structure. - Warming decrease the biomass
  of producers, does not affect that of consumers => top heavy food webs <-
  consistent with metabolic theory :: warming boosts metabolism => boosts
  enegetic demand => greater consumption of intermediate TL by fish =>
  relaxation of grazing pressure. - Mk for effects of nutrients reduced at high
  T unknown. - Size of top predator important to consider. @ CONCL - Warming
  may strengthen top down control.%

    The relationship between population density and sexual reproduction is
  explored for planktonic rotifer populations. It has been argued that
  selection favors sex at population maxima because of favorable probabilities
  of encounter. Factors determining the probability of encounter are examined.
  Experimentally determined parameters for males and females (swimming speed,
  duration of fertility, net fecundity, and encounter distance) are used to
  investigate density effects on the probability of encounter. As population
  density increases, the probability of encounter also increases sigmoidally.
  The probability of a female encountering a male during her fertile period
  begins to increase rapidly at ≈ 50 males/1. The increase continues until it
  becomes asymptotic at ≈ 1000 males/1, where the probability of a female
  encountering, at least one male during her fertile period approaches one. The
  duration of female fertility is less than that of males, causing the female
  curve to be displaced toward higher population densities. Critical density,
  the population density where Ro′ is exactly equal to one, for males and
  females is 11.7 and 141 individuals/1, respectively. The precision of the
  model was evaluated by observing the frequency of male-female encounters
  during 212 5-min observation periods. The observed encounter rate was
  1.49/min, compared to a predicted rate of 1.53/ min. These values are not
  significantly different as determined by t-test. The constraints placed on
  the timing of sex by population density are discussed. {\textcopyright}

    Three drainage systems in British Columbia, Canada, contain divergent
  parapatric lake-stream pairs of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
  aculeatus): Drizzle and Mayer Lakes on Graham Island, Queen Charlotte
  Islands, and Misty Lake on northeastern Vancouver Island. Ecological and
  morphological differences between members of all three lake-stream pairs are
  strikingly similar; lake fish are melanistic and slim bodied with smaller
  mouths and more gill rakers than the mottled-brown and robust-bodied stream
  sticklebacks. We estimated the level of genetic divergence between lake and
  stream fish in Misty Lake and tested hypotheses of single versus multiple
  origins of the pairs by assaying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction site
  variation in samples from the three lake systems. MtDNA analysis revealed the
  existence of two highly divergent lineages differing by 2.7% in sequence. One
  lineage predom- inated in Misty stream fish (73%), whereas the other lineage
  predominated in Misty Lake samples (96%). Comparable forms (lake or stream)
  in the different lakes did not cluster together in terms of mtDNA nucleotide
  divergence, suggesting that the pairs have had independent origins. We
  concluded that: (1) divergent mtDNA lineages in North Pacific sticklebacks
  stem from historical isolation in the two major glacial refugia proposed for
  the North Pacific (Beringia and Cascadia); (2) the stream and lake pair in
  Misty Lake are distinct gene pools; (3) the divergence between parapatric
  lake and stream Gasterosteus represents parallel evolution having occurred at
  least twice in the North Pacific; and (4) different scales of evolutionary
  divergence exist in North Pacific Gasterosteus, that is, a relatively ancient
  divergence of mtDNA clades as well as recent (i.e., postglacial) divergence
  of ecotypes within major clades.%

    So far a considerable number of studies have been carried out on estimating
  parameters and completing imperfect parts of dynamical equations of an
  ecological system from a set of observation data. This paper presents a new
  method for such purposes by using a multi-layer neural network with residual
  minimization training, where an object function composed of a sum of squared
  residuals of supposed governing equations at collocation points and squared
  deviations of the solutions from observation data is minimized. Firstly, we
  applied this method to analysis of "model observation data" produced by
  numerical integration of equations of a predator-prey system. As a result the
  parameters included in the model equations are recovered with considerably
  high accuracy even when artificial random noises are added to the original
  solutions. Then, we applied it successfully to real time-series data of
  protozoan populations. It is concluded that the new method can be effectively
  applied to analyses of time-series data in the field of the ecological
  science. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Trophic relationships, such as those between predator and prey or between
  pathogen and host, are key interactions linking species in ecological food
  webs. The structure of these links and their strengths have major
  consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and
  strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using
  observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show
  that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses
  when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid
  evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations, in
  rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats, show that the predator or
  pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey
  or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly
  linked in these experimental microcosms, but without this knowledge, we would
  infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not
  at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics
  occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring
  defense against attack, and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with
  other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we
  developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the
  phage-bacteria experiments, where bacterial evolution could be tracked.
  Modeling suggests that rapid evolution may also confound experimental
  approaches to measuring interaction strength, but it identifies certain
  experimental designs as being more robust against potential confounding by
  rapid evolution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Yoshida et al.%

    Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales1–7 .
  However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological
  dynamics8 are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions8 .
  Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator
  density affects predator–prey (rotifer–algal) cycles in laboratory
  microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our
  system that allows prey evolution9 .We verified the predicted existence of an
  evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against
  consumption, and exam- ined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the
  evolution- ary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures
  (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical
  quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas
  multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cul- tures produced long cycles
  with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted.
  These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter
  predator–prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand
  population oscillations in nature10,11 cannot neglect potential effects from
  ongoing rapid evolution.%

    - Evolutionary response of the prey (i.e. tendency to clump up) slows down
  predation cycles. This is an experimental evidence of a simple eco-evo
  feedback. - Also points at the fact that eco-evo feedbacks might be common
  and that we cannot neglect rapid evolution in natural systems. 1.
  Introduction - Test effect of genetic variation on population dynamics in
  prey predator system 2. Methods - Mathematical model (ODE) predicting shifts
  in population dynamics with genetic diversity in prey. (long cycles for
  diverse preys, short lotka-voltera cycles for clonal populations). Phenotype:
  trade off between competitivity and resistance to predation. - Experimentally
  tested model prediction in microcosm. Manipulated prey genetic variation:
  population of a miture of small predator resistant preys (less competitive)
  and bigger less resistant preys, or clonal of either phenotype. And monitor
  population dynamics. Small phenotype is an evolutionary of the prey to
  exposure to the predator. 3. Results - Find long cycles in polymorphic
  populations. - Short cycles in oligomorphic populations. 4. Discussion -
  Shows importance of phenotypic variation for population dynamics. - Moreover
  as phenotype is obtained by an evolutionary response, and it implies shifts
  in genetic structure, results implies that fast evolutionary response can be
  a mechanism underlying observed population dynamics. - YET, this is caused by
  changes in standing genetic variation, namely displacement of biomass on
  phenotypic axis, this is simply selection, a very restraint form of
  evolutionary response.%
