abstract = {It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels, experience higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear whether this prediction is consistent with the effect of warming on the trophic structure of natural systems. Furthermore, effects of temperature at the species level, which arise through a change in species composition, may differ from those at the population level, which arise through a change in population structure. We investigate this by building species-level trophic networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy for population structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual fish samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We estimated effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of nodes), vertical trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and distribution of biomass across trophic level (correlation between trophic level and biomass) in these networks. We found a positive effect of temperature on total trophic diversity in both species- and size-structured trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks, but the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic networks. These results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower vertical trophic diversity in size-structured networks, and a higher one in species-level networks. This suggests that vertical trophic diversity is shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature on population structure and on species composition. Our results hence demonstrate that effects of temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across levels of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying complex changes in network structure and functioning with warming.},

abstract = {Recent investigations have shown that processes within the planktonic microbial web are of great significance for the functioning of limnetic ecosystems. However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it. Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates, small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids) seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web. Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Potential community effects of nutrient enhancement are a topic of theoretical interest and increasing management concern in coastal marine systems. While increased nutrient levels may lead to increased microalgal production and biomass, studies have provided variable evidence regarding the existence of upward cascade effects on macrofauna. In benthic marine communities, limitation by predation or factors preventing recruitment response may contribute to weak coupling between resource availability and macrobenthos abundances. We conducted blocked nutrient addition and predator exclusion experiments in the intertidal of two estuaries that varied in background nutrient concentrations (Cape Fear and White Oak, southeastern North Carolina). Benthic community comparisons were also made among these and two other North Carolina estuaries to examine correlations in distribution patterns. Cape Fear, which had the highest background nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, also had highest ambient benthic microalgal biomass. There was no significant response of microalgal biomass to local nutrient additions in Cape Fear and only one macrofaunal taxon during one season exhibited abundance responses to nutrient additions. White Oak, with lower background nutrient levels, was characterized by significant microalgal responses to nutrient additions and significant macrofauna abundance responses for 50% of the species examined during summer experiments. However, all of these macrofauna declined in abundance with nutrient enhancement while biomass remained constant or significantly increased with nutrient additions. This suggests a complex response of macrofauna to nutrient additions in this estuary with greater biomass per individual but a corresponding decline in abundances. Top-down/bottom-up interactive effects were observed for haustoriid amphipods, which were uncommon or absent when predators had access, but exhibited strong biomass responses to nutrient enhancement when predators were excluded. These results support a growing body of literature that indicates the importance of background conditions in regulating benthic community responses to nutrient enhancement. However, responses may be complex with biomass per individual rather than densities being the primary response variable for some taxa and predator moderation of responses occurring for some taxa but not others. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Summary 1. Predicting competitive outcomes in communities frequently involves inferences based on deterministic population models since these provide clear criteria for exclusion (e.g., R* rule) or long-term coexistence (e.g., mutual invasibility). 2. However, incorporating stochasticity into population- or community-level processes into models is necessary if the goal is to explain variation in natural systems, which are inherently stochastic. 3. Similarly, in systems with demographic or environmental stochasticity, weaker competitors have the potential to exclude superior competitors, contributing to what is known as 'competitive indeterminancy'. The importance of such effects for natural communities is unknown, in part because it is difficult to demonstrate that multiple forms of stochasticity are present in these communities. Moreover, the effects of multiple forms of stochasticity on competitive outcomes are largely untested, even in theory. 4. Here, we address these issues by examining the role of stochasticity in replicated communities of flour beetles (Tribolium sp.). To do so, we developed a set of two-species stochastic Ricker models incorporating four distinct forms of stochasticity: environmental stochasticity, demographic stochasticity, demographic heterogeneity, and stochastic sex determination. 5. By fitting models to experimental data, and simulating fit models to examine long term behavior, we found that both the duration of tranisent coexistence and the degree of competitive indeterminacy were sensitive to the forms of stochasticity included in our models. These findings suggest current estimates of extinction risk, coexistence, and time until competitive exclusion in communities may not be accurate when based on models that exclude relevant forms of stochasticity.},

Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a replarisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically.

We tested the impact of elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months. Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. 3. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoobenthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes. 4.

1. Introduction
- Need to improve our ability to forecast the state of our ecosystems.
- Direct + indirect effects of temperature.
- Freshwater systems particularly impacted by warming (check article for list of factors).
- Temperature disrupts trophic interactions (top-down and bottom-up control).
- T -> affects body size. 

@ Reasons why effects of T are potentially unpredictable
- In freshwater systems pellagic and benthic are different, and interconnected. No classic size structure in benthic trophic interactions. => disrupt effects of T on the whole food web. 
- Indirect effects of T on microbial community unknown.


2. M&M

- Mesocosm experiment in tanks.
- Microbial communities + periphyton + phytoplankton + zooplankton + invertebrates.
- Treatments: warming (control, + 3 degrees); nutrients (control, enriched); fishes (control, addition of 5 sticklebacks = top predator).
- 16 months + sampling on regular basis.
- Measure biomass.

3. Results
- Warming and nutrients amplified effects of fish.
- Fish produce bottom heavy food webs (boosts periphyton, etc.).
- Warming reduces phytopl biomass.

4. Discussion

- Effect of temperature depend on food web structure.
- Warming decrease the biomass of producers, does not affect that of consumers => top heavy food webs <- consistent with metabolic theory :: warming boosts metabolism => boosts enegetic demand => greater consumption of intermediate TL by fish => relaxation of grazing pressure.
- Mk for effects of nutrients reduced at high T unknown.
- Size of top predator important to consider.

@ CONCL
- Warming may strengthen top down control.},

However, it is usually hard to do for most of the ecological and environmental problems, because of the lack of a consistent theoretical background. Neural networks are universal and flexible models for linear and non-linear systems. This paper aimed to modeling an ecosystem using neural network models and the conventional model, and assessing their effectiveness in the dynamic simulation of ecosystem. Elman neural network model, linear neural network model, and linear ordinary differential equation were developed to simulate the dynamics of Chinese cabbage growth system recorded in the field. Matlab codes for these neural network models were given. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to detect the robustness of these models. The results showed that Elman neural network model could simulate the multivariate non-linear system at the desired accuracy. Linear neural network model may simulate such a non-linear system only in certain conditions. Conventional linear ordinary differential equation yielded divergent outputs in the dynamic simulation of the multivariate non-linear system. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the learning rate influenced the simulation performance of linear neural network model. Transfer function of the second layer in Elman neural network model would influence the simulation performance of this model, but little influence was produced when other functions were changed. Elman neural network was proven to be a robust model. Sensitivity analysis showed that the different choices of functions and parameters in neural network model would influence the performance of simulation.

Actually, I find that counteruntuitive to have understood that changes were happening over millions of years, where we could have understood first that they were happening over decades, which would have informed us of the former.

Nonetheless, generating sufficient data to test predictions about eco-evolutionary dynamics has proved challenging, particularly in natural contexts. Here we argue that genomic data can be integrated into the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics in ways that deepen our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution. Specifically, we outline five major questions in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics for which genomic data may provide answers. Although genomic data alone will not be sufficient to resolve these challenges, integrating genomic data can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of phenotypic change, help elucidate the mechanisms driving eco-evolutionary dynamics, and lead to more accurate evolutionary predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.},
annote = {takeaway
- Using genomic data can be useful to study fast evolutionary responses. But we are still far off because the genetic basis of traits is usually unkown so that changes in the genetic structure are hard to link to phenotypic change and thus cannot serve as direct evidence.
- The connection with genomic data in natural systems is too far from reach yet... I understand that the basic mechanisms for feedbacks, but also simply for linking genomic data to fitness are yet not fully understood, so linking them is yet too ambitious.

Notes:
- The authors open with the interesting prospect of linking our observations on fast evolution to longer term macroevoltuionary outcomes. This links up to the statement made by Grant and Grant 2003.
- The authors seem to support the view that most rapid evolutionary seem to be underpinned by many loci, rather than one strong effect loci.
- The authors ask interesting questions: how often is evolution fast enough, which links to the study of delong et al. 2019. and they question the effect size of evo to eco effects compared to eco to eco effects, which links with the need highlighted by brunner et al. 2019 and Hendry 2017 for an actual quantification of these effects. Also they question the actual genetic structure underlying these changes.
- The author points at a flaw of all approaches to date in that they relie on phenotypes that we understand and can measure easily. This is a problem that I foresaw, I suggest that we move away from studying specific phenotypes and start scoring composite phenotypes (e.g. filtered through a random forest).

More studies should focus on revealing eco-evolutionary dynamics as they play out in the “real world,” as opposed to laboratories and mesocosms. At the community and ecosystem levels, increasing effort should be directed towards the importance of evolution acting through population density, as opposed to only direct per-capita effects. More work should be directed towards the effects of whole-community evolution, as opposed to the evolution of only particular focal species. New and innovative approaches are needed for studying how natural selection resists evolutionary and ecological change, thus generating cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics.

One emerging tool for this goal is high-throughput sequencing technology, which can now be used to scan the genome for signs of environmental selection in any species and any system. This explosion of data provides a powerful new window into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and although there has been some success in using genomic data to predict responses to selection in fields such as agriculture, thus far genomic data are rarely integrated into predictive frameworks of future adaptation in natural populations. Here, we review both theoretical and empirical studies of adaptation to rapid environmental change, focusing on areas where genomic data are poised to contribute to our ability to estimate species and population persistence and adaptation. We advocate for the need to study and model evolutionary response architectures, which integrate spatial information, fitness estimates, and plasticity with genetic architecture. Understanding how these factors contribute to adaptive responses is essential in efforts to predict the responses of species and ecosystems to future environmental change.},

- To predict the eco-evolutionary response of communities to climate change models need to combine genetic architectures of traits, plasticity, and population dynamics.

1. Introduction
- Outstanding questions: what drives the balance between plastic and evolutionary response?
- We have understanding of various aspects of the architecture of feedbacks in isolation, but not in which context they work together or in isolation (e.g. plasticity).
- Response to environmental change may be highly polygenic => response through analysis of quantitative trait models. Better data from the genomic expansion will facilitate such investigations. Modularity, instead of simple alleles, may be to consider.
- Gene flow, underpinned by habitat and population structure, does not prevent adaptation but alters it, should be accounted for.
- Highly polygenic architectures may yield several molecular routes to achieve the same adaptation => increases the complexity of the response architecture. The author then suggests that then it may be common for different populations to adapt in the same way but via different molecular routes, which complexifies comparison btwn studies. Points at the importance of identifying general patterns rather than idiosyncratic routes.
- Interplay between natural selection and plasticity unclear in natural populations.
- Despite huge progress in genomics, our ability to characterize the ecological context of selection underpinning changes in genetic variation.
- They advocate for the development and implementation of a general theory on the architecture of evolutionary responses. The rise of genomics will provide the empirical data to test such models.
- "a thor- ough understanding of genetic architecture should include the number of loci associated with environmental tolerance and their effect sizes, the locations of those loci within the genome, and the linkage structure among them"
- Theory still unsatisfactorilly models response architecture (never accounts for most important mechanisms). Yet it may yield important conservation applications.},

abstract = {Populations of animals and plants often undergo conspicuous ecological changes when subjected to climatic extremes. Evolutionary changes may accompany them but are less easily detected. We show that Darwin's finches on a Galapagos island underwent two evolutionary changes after a severe El Nino event caused changes in their food supply. Small beak sizes were selectively favoured in one granivorous species when large seeds became scarce. The effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation as a result of high trait heritabilities. Hybridization between this species and two others resulted in gene exchange, but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness was much enhanced under the altered feeding conditions. These observations imply that if global warming increases the frequency or severity of El Nino events on the Galapagos, microevolutionary changes in animal and plant populations are to be anticipated.},

abstract = {Many quantitative traits are labile (e.g. somatic growth rate, reproductive timing and investment), varying over the life cycle as a result of behavioural adaptation, developmental processes and plastic responses to the environment. At the population level, selection can alter the distribution of such traits across age classes and among generations. Despite a growing body of theoretical research exploring the evolutionary dynamics of labile traits, a data-driven framework for incorporating such traits into demographic models has not yet been developed. Integral projection models (IPMs) are increasingly being used to understand the interplay between changes in labile characters, life histories and population dynamics. One limitation of the IPM approach is that it relies on phenotypic associations between parents and offspring traits to capture inheritance. However, it is well-established that many different processes may drive these associations, and currently, no clear consensus has emerged on how to model micro-evolutionary dynamics in an IPM framework. We show how to embed quantitative genetic models of inheritance of labile traits into age-structured, two-sex models that resemble standard IPMs. Commonly used statistical tools such as GLMs and their mixed model counterparts can then be used for model parameterization. We illustrate the methodology through development of a simple model of egg-laying date evolution, parameterized using data from a population of Great tits (Parus major). We demonstrate how our framework can be used to project the joint dynamics of species' traits and population density. We then develop a simple extension of the age-structured Price equation (ASPE) for two-sex populations, and apply this to examine the age-specific contributions of different processes to change in the mean phenotype and breeding value. The data-driven framework we outline here has the potential to facilitate greater insight into the nature of selection and its consequences in settings where focal traits vary over the lifetime through ontogeny, behavioural adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, as well as providing a potential bridge between theoretical and empirical studies of labile trait variation.},
annote = {Takeaway
- Combined IPMs with quantitative genetics
- Added an extra variable to allow plastic change in the phenotype on top of the breeding values.
- Used the age structure price equation to partition the contribution of different demographic processes to the changes in the trait.

abstract = {Demographic population dynamics, gene flow, and local adaptation may influence each other and lead to coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, especially in species inhabiting fragmented heterogeneous environments. Here, I review long-term research on eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics in the Glanville fritillary butterfly inhabiting a large network of approximately 4,000 meadows in Finland. The metapopulation persists in a balance between frequent local extinctions and recolonizations. The genetic spatial structure as defined by neutral markers is much more coarse-grained than the demographic spatial structure determined by the fragmented habitat, yet small-scale spatial structure has important consequences for the dynamics. I discuss three examples of eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics. (i) Extinction-colonization metapopulation dynamics influence allele frequency changes in the phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) gene, which leads to strong associations between genetic variation in Pgi and dispersal, recolonization, and local population dynamics. (ii) Inbreeding in local populations increases their risk for extinction, whereas reciprocal effects between inbreeding, population size, and emigration represent likely eco-evolutionary feedbacks. (iii) Genetically determined female oviposition preference for two host plant species exhibits a cline paralleling a gradient in host plant relative abundances, and host plant preference of dispersing females in relation to the host plant composition of habitat patches influences immigration (gene flow) and recolonization (founder events). Eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics in heterogeneous environments may not lead to directional evolutionary changes unless the environment itself changes, but eco-evolutionary dynamics may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation attributable to fluctuating selection in space and time.},

We do this by analyzing a general eco-evolutionary predator-prey model using four methods: Method 1 identifies how eco-evolutionary feedbacks alter system stability in the fast and slow evolution limits; Method 2 identifies how the amount of standing predator genetic variation alters system stability; Method 3 identifies how the phase lags in predator-prey cycles depend on the amount of genetic variation; and Method 4 determines conditions for different cycle shapes in the fast and slow evolution limits using geometric singular perturbation theory. With these four methods, we identify the conditions under which predator evolution alters system stability and shapes of predator-prey cycles, and how those effect depend on the amount of genetic variation in the predator population. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the relations between the four methods. This work shows how the four methods can be used in tandem to make general predictions about eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks.},

abstract = {Unifying ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology promises a more complete understanding of the processes that link different levels of biological organization across space and time. Feedbacks across levels of organization link theory associated with eco-evolutionary dynamics, niche construction and the geographic mosaic theory of co-evolution. We describe a conceptual model, which builds upon previous work that shows how feedback among different levels of biological organization can link ecosystem and evolutionary processes over space and time. We provide empirical examples across terrestrial and aquatic systems that indicate broad generality of the conceptual framework and discuss its macroevolutionary consequences. Our conceptual model is based on three premises: genetically based species interactions can vary spatially and temporally from positive to neutral (i.e. no net feedback) to negative and drive evolutionary change; this evolutionary change can drive divergence in niche construction and ecosystem function; and lastly, such ecosystem-level effects can reinforce spatiotemporal variation in evolutionary dynamics. Just as evolution can alter ecosystem function locally and across the landscape differently, variation in ecosystem processes can drive evolution locally and across the landscape differently. By highlighting our current knowledge of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in ecosystems, as well as information gaps, we provide a foundation for understanding the interplay between biodiversity and ecosystem function through an eco-evolutionary lens. A plain language summary is available for this article.},
annote = {Takeaway:
- eco-evolutionary feedbacks have the potential to affect ecosystem processes; e.g. guppies evolving larger body sizes also have higher excretion rates, which alters nutrient recycling rates; e.g. plants divergence in genetic structure leads to changes in litter decomposition and mineralisation; but the ubiquity of these effects remains unclear.

Notes
- the paper tries to link eco-evolutionary feedbacks to ecosystem functioning and processes (e.g. mineralisation). I think this is a bit too early for looking at ecosystem level impacts fo feedbacks, given that we do not understand the basics.

Side Notes

We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a “Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)” since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

abstract = {We need to understand joint ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to predict future threats to biological diversity. The ‘evolving metacommunity' framework emphasizes that interactions between ecological and evolutionary mechanisms at both local and regional scales will drive community dynamics during climate change. Theory suggests that ecological and evolutionary dynamics often interact to produce outcomes different from those predicted based on either mechanism alone. We highlight two of these dynamics: (i) species interactions prevent adaptation of nonresident species to new niches and (ii) resident species adapt to changing climates and thereby prevent colonization by nonresident species. The rate of environmental change, level of genetic variation, source-sink structure, and dispersal rates mediate between these potential outcomes. Future models should evaluate multiple species, species interactions other than competition, and multiple traits. Future experiments should manipulate factors such as genetic variation and dispersal to determine their joint effects on responses to climate change. Currently, we know much more about how climates will change across the globe than about how species will respond to these changes despite the profound effects these changes will have on global biological diversity. Integrating evolving metacommunity perspectives into climate change biology should produce more accurate predictions about future changes to species distributions and extinction threats.},

abstract = {Price's extended covariance selection mathematics is applied to class-structured populations with additional assumptions, to derive the 'genetic Price Equation with class structure'. Each individual belongs to a class, and there may be overlapping generations; the equation is genetic because the trait is restricted to an arbitrary weighted sum of allele frequencies. Two special cases are then considered, a demography-like case corresponding to Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, and a sex-ratio-like case corresponding to Fisher's sex ratio argument: these differ in whether it is natural to assume that the per-capita or the total reproductive values of each class are maintained from the parental to the descendant population. These cases also match the two existing attempts to eliminate from the effects of natural selection those passive changes in allele frequencies that are caused by the class structure, and suggest improvements in one of them.

Previous class-structured Price Equations and a 'fundamental theorem' are linked to these results. The power of Price's formal approach is vividly illustrated by this lucid conspectus of otherwise self-standing theories with confusing interconnections.},

Here we construct an eco-evolutionary model for dispersal by combining a stochastic patch occupancy metapopulation model with a model for changes in the frequency of fast-dispersing individuals in local populations. We test the model using data on allelic variation in the gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), which is strongly associated with dispersal rate in the Glanville fritillary butterfly. Population-specific measures of immigration and extinction rates and the frequency of fast-dispersing individuals among the immigrants explained 40% of spatial variation in Pgi allele frequency among 97 local populations. The model clarifies the roles of founder events and gene flow in dispersal evolution and resolves a controversy in the literature about the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation on the evolution of dispersal.},

abstract = {Current rates of environmental change are exceeding the capacity of many populations to adapt to new conditions and thus avoid demographic collapse and ultimate extinction. In particular, cold-water freshwater fish species are predicted to experience strong selective pressure from climate change and a wide range of interacting anthropogenic stressors in the near future. To implement effective management and conservation measures, it is crucial to quantify the maximum rate of change that cold-water freshwater fish populations can withstand. Here, we present a spatially explicit eco-genetic individual-based model, inSTREAM-Gen, to predict the eco-evolutionary dynamics of stream-dwelling trout under anthropogenic environmental change. The model builds on a well-tested demographic model, which includes submodels of river dynamics, bioenergetics, and adaptive habitat selection, with a new genetic module that allows exploration of genetic and life-history adaptations to new environments. The genetic module models the transmission of two key traits, size at emergence and maturity size threshold. We parameterized the model for a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population at the warmest edge of its range to validate it and analyze its sensitivity to parameters under contrasting thermal profiles. To illustrate potential applications of the model, we analyzed the population's demographic and evolutionary dynamics under scenarios of (1) climate change-induced warming, and (2) warming plus flow reduction resulting from climate and land use change, compared to (3) a baseline of no environmental change. The model predicted severe declines in density and biomass under climate warming. These declines were lower than expected at range margins because of evolution towards smaller size at both emergence and maturation compared to the natural evolution under the baseline conditions. Despite stronger evolutionary responses, declining rates were substantially larger under the combined warming and flow reduction scenario, leading to a high probability of population extinction over contemporary time frames. Therefore, adaptive responses could not prevent extinction under high rates of environmental change. Our model demonstrates critical elements of next generation ecological modelling aiming at predictions in a changing world as it accounts for spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity, while merging individual behaviour and bioenergetics with microevolutionary adaptations.},

@article{Siegal2007,
abstract = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are 'scale free.' That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein-protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that 'top-down' inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene's location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene's connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

- I can use this paper to justify using a three-species trophic network, because it is a fundamental component of natural food webs.
- The author state that there are few empirical demonstrations of population dynamics for three-species systems. I deduce from it that at that point, it was not even possible to assess generalisation.
- Flagellates did tend to go extinct, so they pumped them artificially at around 4 % pday.
- The authors state that they reported only runs with no evidence of prey defense evolution, but that evolution was common in their runs.
- Looking at their equations I realised I did not consider the possibility for fluctuations in resource availability. This is one of the hidden variables. I will need to think about that.
- Overall, they state that results are "exactly" as predicted. I would argue that qualitatively this is seems correct but quantitatively the story may be different.
- They state that the peak of flagellate being so close to the algae can be due to a strong dominant drive by the rotifer population, though they only hypothesise that. This seems to be the case in other microzooplankton systems. Your results confirm this and potentially increase the complexity of the interactions.
- They still argue that prey evolution played at best a minor role in explaining the dynamics. However, they do admit that they did not have direct evidence for supporting constant interaction strength.

abstract = {Abstract The field of eco-evolutionary dynamics is developing rapidly, with a growing number of well-designed experiments quantifying the impact of evolution on ecological processes and patterns, ranging from population demography to community composition and ecosystem functioning. The key challenge remains to transfer the insights of these proof-of-principle experiments to natural settings, where multiple species interact and the dynamics are far more complex than those studied in most experiments. Here, we discuss potential pitfalls of building a framework on eco-evolutionary dynamics that is based on data on single species studied in isolation from interspecific interactions, which can lead to both under- and overestimation of the impact of evolution on ecological processes. Underestimation of evolution-driven ecological changes could occur in a single-species approach when the focal species is involved in co-evolutionary dynamics, whereas overestimation might occur due to increased rates of evolution following ecological release of the focal species. In order to develop a multi-species perspective on eco-evolutionary dynamics, we discuss the need for a broad-sense definition of ?eco-evolutionary feedbacks? that includes any reciprocal interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes, next to a narrow-sense definition that refers to interactions that directly feed back on the interactor that evolves. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of using more natural settings in eco-evolutionary studies by gradually adding complexity: (a) multiple interacting species within a guild, (b) food web interactions and (c) evolving metacommunities in multiple habitat patches in a landscape. A literature survey indicated that only a few studies on microbial systems so far developed a truly multi-species approach in their analysis of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and mostly so in artificially constructed communities. Finally, we provide a road map of methods to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in more natural settings. Eco-evolutionary studies involving multiple species are necessarily demanding and might require intensive collaboration among research teams, but are highly needed. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

Time-series data from laboratory blowfly populations (Lucilia sericata) have been analysed in a separate study, with a statistical modelling approach that incorporated density dependences as unspecified (non-parametric) functions. In this study, we assessed density-dependent structures by manipulating densities of larvae and adults in cohorts of blowflies and measuring the demographic rates. We here compare the density-dependent structures revealed by the cohort experiments with those estimated by the non-parametric model. This model estimated the demographic rates to have the following density-dependent structures: (i) larval survival was non-linearly density-dependent (a 'humped' function), (ii) adult survival was density-independent, and (iii) reproductive rate decreased with adult density. In the cohort experiments reported here, (i) juvenile survival exhibited a positive density dependence in low densities (facilitation), which became negative at higher densities (competition). Pupal and adult size decreased with initial larval density. (ii) Adult survival was reduced by high initial larval density, but it was independent of adult density. (iii) Reproductive rate was reduced by high initial larval density, and by high adult density in populations of large individuals (from low larval density). Hence, the results from these experiments support the non-parametric model estimates regarding density-dependent structures of demographic rates in the blowfly populations. The mean demographic rates, however, were apparently underestimated by the model. We conclude that non-parametric modelling is a useful first approach for exploratory analysis of ecological time-series data.},

abstract = {Coevolution is relentlessly creating and maintaining biodiversity and therefore has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Previous theoretical studies have mostly considered coevolution between genetically symmetric traits (i.e. coevolution between two continuous quantitative traits or two discrete Mendelian traits). However, recent empirical evidence indicates that coevolution can occur between genetically asymmetric traits (e.g. between quantitative and Mendelian traits). We examine consequences of antagonistic coevolution mediated by a quantitative predator trait and a Mendelian prey trait, such that predation is more intense with decreased phenotypic distance between their traits (phenotype matching). This antagonistic coevolution produces a complex pattern of bifurcations with bistability (initial state dependence) in a two-dimensional model for trait coevolution. Furthermore, with eco-evolutionary dynamics (so that the trait evolution affects predator-prey population dynamics), we find that coevolution can cause rich dynamics including anti-phase cycles, in-phase cycles, chaotic dynamics and deterministic predator extinction. Predator extinction is more likely to occur when the prey trait exhibits complete dominance rather than semidominance and when the predator trait evolves very rapidly. Our study illustrates how recognizing the genetic architectures of interacting ecological traits can be essential for understanding the population and evolutionary dynamics of coevolving species.},

- Produces more diverse eco-evo dynamics than purely quantitative evolution.
- Higher evolutionary efficiency of predator (Heritability) can favour better tracking of prey evolutionary dynamics but also extinction if too good.
- Different genetic architecture can produce distinct ecological dynamics.

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary processes in hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological systems.

abstract = {Correlations between population density, natural selection and phenotypic change are widespread and may comprise an eco-evolutionary feedback loop, yet we still know very little about the causes of connections between them. Isolating the mechanistic links in eco-evolutionary feedback loops, both in terms of identifying sources of variation in traits and in terms of determining how and why natural selection varies with population density, can provide key insight into avian population dynamics. Here, we summarize more than a decade of findings in western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) to illustrate the multiple and potentially interacting mechanisms that can cause simultaneous changes in traits and population density. In previous work, we discovered correlated changes in aggression, population density and natural selection during the process of colonization. Here we provide evidence that density-dependent selection, maternal effects and demographic consequences of selection on aggression may all play a role in driving feedback between phenotypic change and population density. Thus, this system provides an example of the multiple mechanistic links that can produce such feedback loops and emphasizes the importance of investigating alternative hypotheses for correlated patterns of ecological and phenotypic change even when there is strong evidence that natural selection is acting on a trait. Ultimately, identifying these mechanisms is crucial, as eco-evolutionary feedback have the potential to explain avian population cycles, range dynamics, population persistence, and even patterns of species coexistence.},

- Evolution is likely invovled in explain avian population dynamics and it is important to undertand the mechanisms involved.
- Many of the population cycles observed may be underpinned by evolution (more than suspected).

abstract = {It is well recognized that models in the life sciences can be sensitive to small variations in their model functions, a phenomenon known as 'structural sensitivity'. Conventionally, modelers test for sensitivity by varying parameters for a specific formulation of the model functions, but models can show structural sensitivity to the choice of functional representations used: a particularly concerning problem when system processes are too complex, or insufficiently understood, to theoretically justify specific parameterizations. Here we propose a rigorous test for the detection of structural sensitivity in a system with respect to the local stability of equilibria, the main idea being to project infinite dimensional function space onto a finite dimensional space by considering the local properties of the model functions. As an illustrative example, we use our test to demonstrate structural sensitivity in the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and show that the conventional parameterbased approach can fail to do so. We also consider some implications that structural sensitivity has for ecological modelling: we argue that when the model exhibits structural sensitivity but experimental results remain consistent it may indicate that there is a problem with the model construction, and that in some cases trying to find an 'optimal' parameterization of a model function may simply be impossible when the model exhibits structural sensitivity. Finally, we suggest that the phenomenon of structural sensitivity in biological models may help explain the irregular oscillations often observed in real ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

- The authors propose a test for evaluating structural sensitivity of the model.
- I see this as potentially useful for discussing the "mechanistic pitfall".
- I think other papers on the "mechanistic pitfall" are also good, such as Wood 2001, Jost and Ellner 2000, etc.

* Notes
- In the abstract the authors say that sensitivty should not only be performed on parameters, but also on model structure. And that this is often not done.
- they define structural sensitivity as change in model behaviour with mathematical forumlation of the model.
- They state that conventional model search in a subset of pre-defined parameters is subjective.
- They state that generalising from well-observed populations (e.g. in the lab) to natural populations may not work. I see that they do not even question whether across the same replicates it may be possible. 
- They state that uncertainty arises because of experimental errors but also biological variation. Results can further vary because of model structural sensitivity. References 42-46 may be interesting for supporting that.
- They state that functional relations between system component are not consistent in time, due to a change in unobserved variables (environment, internal state, evolution) which may require a change in the model structure. That is reminding me that no model should be fixed ideally, or at least complex enough to allow for change.},

abstract = {How the neutral diversity is affected by selection and adaptation is investigated in an eco-evolutionary framework. In our model, we study a finite population in continuous time, where each individual is characterized by a trait under selection and a completely linked neutral marker. Population dynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth, and competition between individuals. Trait values influence ecological processes (demographic events, competition), and competition generates selection on trait variation, thus closing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the trait are also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral variation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation, under the assumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the trait under selection. We prove the convergence of the stochastic individual-based process to a new measure-valued diffusive process with jumps that we call Substitution Fleming-Viot Process (SFVP). When restricted to the trait space this process is the Trait Substitution Sequence first introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During the invasion of a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck occurs and the marker associated with this favorable mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously analysing the hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is restored afterwards, we obtain the condition for a time-scale separation; under this condition, we show that the marker distribution is approximated by a Fleming-Viot distribution between two trait substitutions. We discuss the implications of the SFVP for our understanding of the dynamics of neutral variation under eco-evolutionary feedbacks and illustrate the main phenomena with simulations. Our results highlight the joint importance of mutations, ecological parameters, and trait values in the restoration of neutral diversity after a selective sweep.},

abstract = {1. The evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in a species depends on demo- graphic structure (e.g. age- and size-dependent vital rates, migration across sub- populations, mate preferences, and the presence or absence of overlapping generations), which in turn can depend on interspecific interactions with other evolving species. Furthermore, biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning. 2. Models integrating insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and genetic details into a compre- hensive framework. Such models are needed to account for the reciprocal feed- back between evolutionary change and ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic disturbances on natural communities, improve agricul- tural practices and manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens. 3. Here we introduce an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genet- ics simulator and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our approach permits building models that can account for alternative genetic architec- tures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with other evolving species and the spa- tial dynamics of metacommunities. By integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to facilitate the development of models that can further eluci- date eco-evolutionary dynamics. 4. While multi-species, forward-time population genetic models can be computation- ally expensive, we show how our framework leverages relatively economical graph- ics cards installed in modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic co- evolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations. We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the performance gains on small-to-medium sized com- puter clusters.},

abstract = {Withstanding extinction while facing rapid climate change depends on a species' ability to track its ecological niche or to evolve a new one. Current methods that predict climate-driven species' range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species' responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species' local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species' extinction risks under climate change.},

abstract = {Diversity occurs at multiple scales. Within a single population, there is diversity in genotypes and phenotypes. At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species. A number of studies have investigated how diversity at these two scales influence each other through what has been termed eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Here we study a three-species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with very simple genetics, we study an eco-evolutionary model in which the predator's trait is determined by two recombining diallelic loci, so that its mean and variance can evolve, as well as associations (linkage disequilibrium) between the loci. We ask how eco-evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. We uncover a novel eco-evolutionary feedback between the prey densities and the linkage disequilibrium between the predator's loci. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.},

abstract = {Predator–prey interactions play a key role in the evolution of species traits through antagonistic coevolutionary arms races. The evolution of beak morphology in the Darwin's finches in response to competition for seed resources is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. The seeds of Tribulus cistoides are an important food source for the largest ground finch species (Geospiza fortis, G. magnirostris, and G. conirostris) in dry months, and the hard spiny morphology of the fruits is a potent agent of selection that drives contemporary evolutionary change in finch beak morphology. Although the effects of these interactions on finches are well known, how seed predation affects the ecology and evolution of the plants is poorly understood. Here we examine whether seed predation by Darwin's finches affects the ecology and evolution of T. cistoides. We ask whether the intensity of seed predation and the strength of natural selection by finches on fruit defense traits vary among populations, islands, years, or with varying finch community composition (i.e., the presence/absence of the largest beaked species, which feed on T. cistoides most easily). We then further test whether T. cistoides fruit defenses have diverged among islands in response to spatial variation in finch communities. We addressed these questions by examining seed predation by finches in 30 populations of T. cistoides over 3 yr. Our study reveals three key results. First, Darwin's finches strongly influence T. cistoides seed survival, whereby seed predation varies with differences in finch community composition among islands and in response to interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Second, finches impose phenotypic selection on T. cistoides fruit morphology, whereby smaller and harder fruits with longer or more spines exhibited higher seed survival. Variation in finch community composition and precipitation also explains variation in phenotypic selection on fruit defense traits. Third, variation in the number of spines on fruits among islands is consistent with divergent phenotypic selection imposed by variation in finch community composition among islands. These results suggest that Darwin's finches and T. cistoides are experiencing an ongoing coevolutionary arms race, and that the strength of this coevolution varies in space and time.},
annote = {takeaway:
- seed predation by darwin's finches influence ecological (survival) and evolutionary processes (quality of seed defence) in T cistoides seeds.
- I see that this studies means that the impact of D-Finch on seed supplies is likely large enough to be detected.
- There is less support for major differences in predation linked to species composition (i.e. presence/absence of magnirostris). I believe this provides limited support for an interaction between finch density dependence and beak size.

Notes:
- the author find a lag effect in the impact of rain on cistoides predation, that being lowest following a particularly wet year.
- The author also suggest that the patterns of variation in seed survival could be in line with a masting strategy, although that would need to be confirmed.},

abstract = {Biologists are increasingly interested in decomposing trait dynamics into underlying processes, such as evolution, plasticity and demography. Four important frameworks that allow for such a decomposition are the quantitative genetic animal model (AM), the ‘Geber' method (GM), the age-structured Price equation (APE) and the integral projection model (IPM). However, as these frameworks have largely been developed independently, they differ in the assumptions they make, the data they require, as well as their outcomes and interpretation. Here, we evaluate how each framework decomposes trait dynamics into underlying processes. To do so, we apply them to simulated data for a hypothetical animal population. Individual body size was affected by, among others, genes, maternal effects and food intake. We simulated scenarios with and without selection on body size and with high and low heritability. The APE and IPM provided similar results, as did the AM and GM, with important differences between the former and the latter. All frameworks detected positive contributions of selection in the high but not in the low selection scenarios. However, only the AM and GM distinguished between the high and low heritability scenarios. Furthermore, the AM and GM revealed a high contribution of plasticity. The APE and IPM attributed most of the change in body size to ontogenetic growth and inheritance, where the latter captures the combined effects of plasticity, maternal effects and heritability. We show how these apparent discrepancies are mostly due to differences in aims and definitions. For example, the APE and IPM capture selection, whereas the AM and GM focus on the response to selection. Furthermore, the frameworks differ in the processes that are ascribed to plasticity and in how they take into account demography. We conclude that no single framework provides the ‘true' contributions of evolution, plasticity and demography. Instead, different research questions require different frameworks. A thorough understanding of the different definitions of their components is necessary for selecting the most appropriate framework for the question at hand and for making biologically meaningful inferences. This work thus supports both future analysis and the careful interpretation of existing work.},
annote = {Takeaways:
- Overall, all methods are constrained on the knowledge of the mechanisms of processes shaping phenotypic change (esp. GM)
- No uncertainty quantification in the methods (except AM)
- All methods rely on linear effects on phenotypic change, no indirect effects are considered, interactions can be implemented but are not considered here

Notes:
- One limitation of the GM is that results are contingent on definitions of processes, which are usually unknown. This is a bit of a chicken and egg scenario, where we use the GM to understand the drivers of evolution, but for that we need the mechanisms, and to know the mechanisms we need the drivers...
- plasticity is hard to distinguish from evolution in most methods
- The four methods, at their heart, come down to fitting a linear model to the time series of changes in the traits, but do not account for the feedback effects of the changes on the traits on the predictors. Except IPMs, but IPMs suffer from the limitations that processes and their dependences on the predictors have to be known => no integrated inference. The behaviour of the IPM is fully determined by the fitting of the linear models, so there again it is not a case of integrated inference.},

abstract = {Changes in the seasonal timing of life history events are documented effects of climate change. We used a general model to study how dispersal and competitive inter- actions affect eco-evolutionary responses to changes in the temporal distribution of re- sources over the season. Specifically, we modeled adaptation of the timing of reproduction and population dynamic responses in two competing populations that disperse between two habitats characterized by an early and late resource peak. We investigated three scenarios of environmental change: (1) food peaks advance in both habitats, (2) in the late habitat only and (3) in the early habitat only. At low dispersal rates the evolutionarily stable timing of reproduction closely matched the local resource peak and the environmental change typically caused population decline. Larger dispersal rates rendered less intuitive eco- evolutionary population responses. First, dispersal caused mismatch between evolution- arily stable timing of reproduction and local resource peaks and as a result, reproductive output for subpopulations could increase as well as decrease when resource availability underwent temporal shifts. Second, population responses were contingent on competition between populations. This could accelerate population declines and cause extinctions or even reverse population trends from negative to positive compared to the low dispersal case. When dispersal rate was large and the early resource peak was advanced available niche space was reduced. Hence, even when a population survived the environmental change and obtained positive equilibrium population density, subsequent adaptation of competing populations could drive it to extinction due to convergent evolution and competitive exclusion. These results shed new light on the role of competition and dis- persal for the evolution of timing of life history events and provide guidelines for un- derstanding short and long-term population response to climate change.},

- Ecological interactions, spatial heterogeneity, dispersal is essential to study response to climate change.

- phenological mismatch can be the outcome of a generalist ESS, 

- High dispersal as well as high phenological variance of resource favors evolution of generalist strategies (because you may find a spot that is timed right for you) and hence favor maintenance of adaptive phenological mismatch

- reduced asynchrony in resource (e.g. habitat homogeneization, see scenario 2) due to climate change can also favor evolution of generalist (adaptive phenological mismatch strategies APMs) and ultimately population synchrony (=> increased competition => lower density => yadayada).

- APMs as ESS may cause interesting co-evolutionary dynamics ().

- phenological mismatch: direct effect of lower reproduction, secondary effects of competition.

Tak- ing inspiration from the dynamical system approach, we outline a general frame- work in which complex dynamics generated by families of differential equations can be learned in a principled way. Two models are derived from this framework. We demonstrate how they can be applied in practice by considering the problem of forecasting fluid flows.

abstract = {Darwinian fitness of an individual is measured by the number of recruits it contributes to the next generation. We studied variation in fitness among members of three cohorts of two species of Darwin's finches living on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major: the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and cactus finch (Geospiza scandens). Individuals of both species live for up to 16 years. Variation in fitness was neither random nor heritable. Non-randomness arises as a result of a few individuals living for an exceptionally long time and breeding many times. For each cohort, the number of recruits per breeder is strongly predicted by the number of fledglings per breeder. In turn, the number of fledglings is strongly predicted by longevity of the breeder. These results suggest that the most important determinant of fitness is the ability of an individual to survive to breed in many years. Morphological traits affect this ability. Although morphological traits are heritable they do not change unidirectionally because they are selected in opposite directions and in different combinations, under fluctuating environmental conditions. Non-random fitness variation in fluctuating populations implies much smaller genetically effective sizes than breeding population sizes.},
annote = {Takeway
- morphological traits in the D-Finch have an effect on longevity (a key component of the fitness of individuals). But this effect is highly inconsistent, possibly due to fluctuations in environmental conditions throughout cohorts.
- Overall, I find two things puzzling. First, how come do we observe such a drastic and significant change in the morphology of these individuals, with so little evidence for impacts on fitness. Second, what is the relative importance of direct effects and interaction in driving inconsistencies in the effects of morphological change on fitness. 

Notes
- Authors provide really interesting data on number of fledglings banded and their individual fitness (% bred). I can see this data be used to have higher resolution of the impacts of phenotypic change on demography (through reproduction and survival).
- The author show that number of offspring produced by offpsprings does not follow null random distributions (NB and poisson), which demonstrate that offspring fitness is not random. I see that this does not demonstrate anything beyond the fact that there is structure in the data that is not captured by the distributions they have used... not very informative.
- The authors start off by saying that studies failed at showing correlations between fitness and morphology, so that they try to find indirect evidence by looking at the correlation between morphology and longevity/offspring recruitment (i.e. survival).
- The authors attribute inconsistencies of effects of morphological traits on fitness components across cohorts to environmental variation. I believe that this is due to the fact that the different cohorts experience quite difference environmental conditions. Do these environmental effects interplay with effects of morphology, or do they compensate them additively, so that statistically they appear as changing in effects? It seems highly likely that environmental effects simply compensate effects of morphology in different cohortes. I am suprised that the authors did not account for that.
- What is reasurring for your analysis is that they tested simple effects of body size (i.e. no interaction with environmental variables). Which justifies you using linear direct effects as a starting point.
- The author shows that finch do skip breeding from time to time (table 1). This means that you might expect lag effects on demography due to breeding, though selective effects on survival are still at play continuously throughout.
- The authors propose an interesting mechanism for phenotypic change: in normal circumstances, flucuating conditions cause fluctuating selection on traits and hence no observable changes, evolutionary change is thus likely only through directional changes in the environment. I would add that this change has to be substantial. I also se that this is what your analysis reveals: you observe compensating contributions of different variables in times of phenotypic stability, which is offset by a greater disruption of the environment.
- This paper makes me wonder whether I should include the time series of the paper to model effects mediated by changes in age structure.},

abstract = {Determining how adaptive evolution can be coupled to ecological processes is key for developing a more integrative understanding of the demographic factors that regulate populations. Intra-specific competition is an especially important ecological process because it generates negative density dependence in demographic rates. Although ecological factors are most often investigated to determine the strength of density dependence, evolutionary processes such as local adaptation could also feed back to shape variation in the strength of density dependence among populations. Using an experimental approach with damselflies, a predaceous aquatic insect, we find evidence that both density-dependent intraspecific competition and local adaptation can reduce per capita growth rates. In some cases, the effects of local adaptation on reducing per capita growth rates exceeded the ecological competitive effects of a doubling of density. However, we also found that these ecological and evolutionary properties of populations are coupled, and we offer two interpretations of the causes underlying this pattern: (1) the strength of density-dependent competition depends on the extent of local adaptation, or (2) the extent of local adaptation is shaped by the strength of density-dependent competition. Regardless of the underlying causal pathway, these results show how eco-evolutionary dynamics can affect a key demographic process regulating populations.},

However, phenotypic plasticity provides the potential for organisms to respond rapidly and effectively to environmental change. Using a 47-year population study of the great tit (Parus major) in the United Kingdom, we show that individual adjustment of behavior in response to the environment has enabled the population to track a rapidly changing environment very closely. Individuals were markedly invariant in their response to environmental variation, suggesting that the current response may be fixed in this population. Phenotypic plasticity can thus play a central role in tracking environmental change; understanding the limits of plasticity is an important goal for future research.},

abstract = {Scientists and decision-makers need tools that can assess which specific pressures lead to ecosystem deterioration, and which measures could reduce these pressures and/or limit their effects. In this context, species distribution models are tools that can be used to help asses these pressures. Evolutionary algorithms represent a collection of promising techniques, inspired by concepts observed in natural evolution, to support the development of species distribution models. They are suited to solve non-trivial tasks, such as the calibration of parameter-rich models, the reduction of model complexity by feature selection and/or the optimization of hyperparameters of other machine learning algorithms. Although widely used in other scientific domains, the full potential of evolutionary algorithms has yet to be explored for applied ecological research. In this synthesis, we study the role of evolutionary algorithms as a machine learning technique to develop the next generation of species distribution models. To do so, we review available methods for species distribution modelling and synthesize literature using evolutionary algorithms. In addition, we discuss specific advantages and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms and present a guideline for their application. We find that evolutionary algorithms are increasingly used to solve specific and challenging problems. Their flexibility, adaptability and transferability in addition to their capacity to find adequate solutions to complex, non-linear problems are considered as main strengths, especially for species distribution models with a large degree of complexity. The need for programming and modelling skills can be considered as a drawback for novice modellers. In addition, setting values for hyperparameters is a challenge. Future ecological research should focus on exploring the potential of evolutionary algorithms that combine multiple tasks in one learning cycle. In addition, studies should focus on the use of novel machine learning schemes (e.g. automated hyperparameter optimization) to apply evolutionary algorithms, preferably in the context of open science. This way, ecologists and model developers can achieve an adaptable and flexible framework for developing tools useful for decision management.},

abstract = {Biological diversity is a key concept in the life sciences and plays a fundamental role in many ecological and evolutionary processes. Although biodiversity is inherently a hier- archical concept covering different levels of organization (genes, population, species, ecological communities and ecosystems), a diversity index that behaves consistently across these different levels has so far been lacking, hindering the development of truly integrative biodiversity studies. To fill this important knowledge gap, we present a unify- ing framework for the measurement of biodiversity across hierarchical levels of organi- zation. Our weighted, information- based decomposition framework is based on a Hill number of order q = 1, which weights all elements in proportion to their frequency and leads to diversity measures based on Shannon's entropy. We investigated the numerical behaviour of our approach with simulations and showed that it can accurately describe complex spatial hierarchical structures. To demonstrate the intuitive and straightfor- ward interpretation of our diversity measures in terms of effective number of compo- nents (alleles, species, etc.), we applied the framework to a real data set on coral reef biodiversity. We expect our framework will have multiple applications covering the fields of conservation biology, community genetics and eco- evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary feedbacks may determine the outcome of predator–prey interactions in nature, but little work has been done to quantify the feedback effect of short-term prey adaptation on predator performance. We tested the effects of prey availability and recent (less than 100 years) prey adaptation on the feeding and growth rate of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), foraging on western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Field surveys showed higher densities and larger average body sizes of mosquitofish in recently introduced populations without bass. Over a six-week mesocosm experiment, bass were presented with either a high or low availability of mosquitofish prey from recently established populations either naive or experienced with bass. Naive mosquitofish were larger, less cryptic and more vulnerable to bass predation compared to their experienced counterparts. Bass consumed more naive prey, grew more quickly with naive prey, and grew more quickly per unit biomass of naive prey consumed. The effect of mosquitofish history with the bass on bass growth was similar in magnitude to the effect of mosquitofish availability. In showing that recently derived predation-related prey phenotypes strongly affect predator performance, this study supports the presence of reciprocal predator–prey trait feedbacks in nature.},
annote = {Takeaway:
- Fryxell shows that Largemouth bass are more effective at eating locally maladapted preys, implying the existing of a feedback between prey adaptation and predator performance.
- I think this study is good as indirect empirical evidence for feedbacks, linked with Siepielski 2016. It does not quantify the feedback itself. This leads me onto thinking that this kind of study is predominant, in contrast there is a lack of direct evidence for feedbacks, which rejoins the point made by Hendry 2019 and Brunner 2019.

Notes:
- I view this study as similar to Siepiellski 2016 in that both studies tests the effect of local adaptations on individual performance. Both studies transplante either Damselflies, or mosquitofish, to a another site and track the performance of individuals. The difference is that Siepielski 2016 test the effects of density on performance relative to locals; whereas Fryxell simply test the effect of maladapted preys on predation.
- They found that largmouth bass predators are more effective at capturing "naive" preys.
- The author suggest that this is evidence for a feedback between prey and predator. 
- I view this study as an indrect evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks. The existence of the potential feedback is implied by the effect of local adaptation on predator performance.},

Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However, most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition(4,5). Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together, high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly, high dispersal did not reduce extinctions, because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition, which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably, climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts, with changes in species richness and traits occuring long after climate stabilization. Therefore, even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today, transient eco-evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity.},

abstract = {Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

In this work we describe differential equations from the viewpoint of data science and discuss the complementary nature between machine learning models and differential equations. We demonstrate the ability to incorporate DifferentialEquations.jl-defined differential equation problems into a Flux-defined neural network, and vice versa. The advantages of being able to use the entire DifferentialEquations.jl suite for this purpose is demonstrated by counter examples where simple integration strategies fail, but the sophisticated integration strategies provided by the DifferentialEquations.jl library succeed. This is followed by a demonstration of delay differential equations and stochastic differential equations inside of neural networks. We show high-level functionality for defining neural ordinary differential equations (neural networks embedded into the differential equation) and describe the extra models in the Flux model zoo which includes neural stochastic differential equations. We conclude by discussing the various adjoint methods used for backpropogation of the differential equation solvers. DiffEqFlux.jl is an important contribution to the area, as it allows the full weight of the differential equation solvers developed from decades of research in the scientific computing field to be readily applied to the challenges posed by machine learning and data science.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to modeling sequential data: the deep equilibrium model (DEQ). Motivated by an observation that the hidden layers of many existing deep sequence models converge towards some fixed point, we propose the DEQ approach that directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding. Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective “depth” of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88% memory reduction in our experiments.},

Here we explored the consequences of changes in species populations for the remaining species within nine exceptionally wellcharacterized empirical food webs, for which, unlike the vast majority of other published webs, feeding links have been fully quantified. Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we found that perturbations to species with few connections have larger net effects (considering both direct and indirect pathways between two species) on the rest of the food web than do disturbances to species that are highly connected. For 40% of predator-prey links, predators had positive net effects on prey populations, due to the predominance of indirect interactions. Our results highlight the fundamental, but often counterintuitive, role of indirect effects for the maintenance of food web complexity and biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can increase the complexity of an ecological network. To date, however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids. Direct and indirect genetic effects resulted in distinct compositions of trophic interactions associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by 20% over the range of genetic variation in the experimental population of host plants. Taken together, our results indicate that intraspecific genetic variation can play a key role in structuring ecological networks, which may in turn affect network persistence.},

- the genetic structure influences the ecological structure of the system. Genetic variation associates with complexity in ecological networks of interactions.


@ Introduction
- Link between intraspecific genetic variation and food web complexity not well known => positive relationship hypothesized

@ Methods
- Planted willows, collected herbivores after some times (galls), monitored predation of galls (presence of parasites)
- Stats to link intraspecific genetic variation to food web complexity (i.e. weighted number of links per nodes)
- Tri trophic systems of plant and insects

@ Results
- Saturating positive link between intraspecific genetic variation and food web complexity.

@ Discussion
- Trophic structure affected by genetic structure
- Still do not know how this plays out "dynamically": how does the loss of genetic diversity interplays with lower food web complexity in determining extinction probability},

abstract = {Competitor species can have evolutionary effects on each other that result in ecological character displacement; that is, divergence in resource-exploiting traits such as jaws and beaks. Nevertheless, the process of character displacement occurring in nature, from the initial encounter of competitors to the evolutionary change in one or more of them, has not previously been investigated. Here we report that a Darwin's finch species (Geospiza fortis) on an undisturbed Gal{\'{a}}pagos island diverged in beak size from a competitor species (G. magnirostris) 22 years after the competitor's arrival, when they jointly and severely depleted the food supply. The observed evolutionary response to natural selection was the strongest recorded in 33 years of study, and close to the value predicted from the high heritability of beak size. These findings support the role of competition in models of community assembly, speciation, and adaptive radiations.},
annote = {Takeaway:
- fortis and magnirostris evolved alongside until a drought where they jointly depleted resource levels, which caused a severe reduction in fortis beak size (and near extinction). The occurrence of a drought in the past at a point where magnirostris was not present yet, and that did not cause the near extinction of the fortis population, implies a causal relationship between competition and the evolutionary reponse of fortis.

Note:
- In 1977, larger finch survived fine to a drought causing a depletion of food supplies. Similar conditions in 2004 almost killed the population of Fortis and Scandens, the only difference being the presence of the larger Finch magnirostris. Following this line of evidence the authors posit that competition was here a causal component of the evolutionary response that followed, namely the sharp drop in mean beak size in fortis. Magnirostris contributed to depleting resources in larger seeds too fast, it is a case of indirect competition. The issue that I see here is that this is assuming that starvation is the main cause for deaths, but the authors did not measure food supplies. 
- I see that this study also demonstrates the importance of beak size in food acquisition, and hence in survival. That leads me onto wondering whether food levels are impacted by the finch species in the initial years of the study.
- This paper really makes me wonder whether I should allow for effects from demography to resources as a way to model indirect effects through resource depletion.},

abstract = {Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used in ecology to describe the dynamical behavior of systems of interacting populations. However, systems of ODEs rarely provide quantitative solutions that are close to real field observations or experimental data because natural systems are subject to environmental and demographic noise and ecologists are often uncertain about the correct parameterization. In this article we introduce "parameter cascades" as an improved method to estimate ODE parameters such that the corresponding ODE solutions fit the real data well. This method is based on the modified penalized smoothing with the penalty defined by ODEs and a generalization of profiled estimation, which leads to fast estimation and good precision for ODE parameters from noisy data. This method is applied to a set of ODEs originally developed to describe an experimental predator-prey system that undergoes oscillatory dynamics. The new parameterization considerably improves the fit of the ODE model to the experimental data sets. At the same time, our method reveals that important structural assumptions that underlie the original ODE model are essentially correct. The mathematical formulations of the two nonlinear interaction terms (functional responses) that link the ODEs in the predator-prey model are validated by estimating the functional responses nonparametrically from the real data. We suggest two major applications of "parameter cascades" to ecological modeling: It can be used to estimate parameters when original data are noisy, missing, or when no reliable priori estimates are available; it can help to validate the structural soundness of the mathematical modeling approach. {\textcopyright} 2008, The International Biometric Society.},

To formalize this hypothesis, we trained recurrent neural networks to reproduce the muscle activity of reaching monkeys. Models had to infer dynamics that could transform simple inputs into temporally and spatially complex patterns of muscle activity. Analysis of trained models revealed that the natural dynamical solution was a low-dimensional oscillator that generated the necessary multiphasic commands. This solution closely resembled, at both the single-neuron and population levels, what was observed in neural recordings from the same monkeys. Notably, data and simulations agreed only when models were optimized to find simple solutions. An appealing interpretation is that the empirically observed dynamics of motor cortex may reflect a simple solution to the problem of generating temporally patterned descending commands.},

Although the feedback loop between population dynamics and coevolution of traits is crucial for understanding long-term stability in ecological assemblages, modelling eco- evolutionary dynamics in species-rich assemblages is still a challenge. We explore how eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence trait evolution and species abundances in 23 empirical antagonistic networks. We show that, if selection due to antagonistic interactions is stronger than other selective pressures, eco- evolutionary feedbacks lead to higher mean species abundances and lower temporal variation in abundances. By contrast, strong selection of antagonistic interactions leads to higher temporal variation of traits and on interaction strengths. Our results present a theoretical link between the study of the species persistence and coevolution in networks of interacting species, point- ing out the ways by which coevolution may decrease the vulnerability of species within antagonistic networks to demographic fluctuation.},

abstract = {* Ecologists now recognize that ecologically important traits sometimes undergo large heritable changes on the same time-scale as ecological change (‘rapid' or ‘contemporary' evolution). We know much less about the meanings of ‘sometimes' (how often?) and ‘important' (how important?). I review some of what I and my collaborators have learned about rapid evolution and suggest some of its implications. * Rapid evolution is common: when conditions change, traits evolve. But the rate of change is hard to predict, even across a set of published laboratory predator–prey experiments, and very similar trait changes can result from very different molecular mechanisms, even within one species. * Evolutionary rescue (adaptive response to a detrimental environmental change) is common, but not always effective. The full range is observed, from little to almost complete compensation for environmental change. * Cases of limited compensation show that strong selection is necessary, but not sufficient for rapid adaptation. The response of the copepod Onychodiaptomus sanguineus to fluctuating predation shows that the time-scale of environmental variation is important. The response of Daphnia galeata to eutrophication shows that life-history trade-offs and constraints can prevent evolution from buffering the entire life history against environmental changes. * Eco-evolutionary dynamics are harder to predict when traits affecting multiple interactions evolve. Theory predicted, and experiments confirmed, a much larger range of possible evolutionary outcomes when a prey species evolves defences against two predators rather than one. These and other recent findings suggest that the devil is in the details: many subtle factors, such as how trade-offs depend on resource availability, can have large effects on eco-evolutionary dynamics. * Ecologists are increasingly engaged in predicting the ecological effects of human impacts such as species introductions and climate change. Forecasting evolutionary responses is part of that challenge. One implication of the ‘newest synthesis' is that rapid adaptation to changing conditions is nothing new, so the past and present can tell us a lot about the future. If prediction is our goal, then developing predictive theory for eco-evolutionary dynamics, and testing it in tractable model systems, should be a priority.},
annote = {0. General notes
- Eco-evo dynamics is new, so generalization is not yet within reach.
- Same eco-evo dynamics, different genetic architecture, which can change at each iteration of eco-evo dynamics: very complex to predict.
- Partitioning ecological and evolutionary contributions to ecosystem dynamics done is several systems.
- Understanding when eco-evo is strong has implications for understanding response of ppoulations to environmental change, and applications in conservation.
- Global dynamics can only be understood by incorporating the dynamics of all elements (all elements in the food web, and the genetic architecture).
- Selection fluctuates and is thus not consistent in time, but hard to understand how this influences dynamics.
- Covariations between traits constraint evolutionary response.
- Also should account for the ecological context.
- This field has applications to climate change study, and conservation.
- The complexity of the dynamics is such that empirical "statistical fishing" for architectures will be too messy/risky/costly => it needs to be preceeded by solid theory and experimental confirmation.
- At this stage, not even sure that we will be able to theoretically break the complexity of the field.},

However, we usually do not have the equation of motion describing the flows, or how they are affected by jumps. To this end, we introduce Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations that provide a data-driven approach to learn continuous and discrete dynamic behavior, i.e., hybrid systems that both flow and jump. Our approach extends the framework of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with a stochastic process term that models discrete events. We then model temporal point processes with a piecewise-continuous latent trajectory, where the discontinuities are caused by stochastic events whose conditional intensity depends on the latent state. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our model on a range of synthetic and real-world marked point process datasets, including classical point processes (such as Hawkes processes), awards on Stack Overflow, medical records, and earthquake monitoring.},

abstract = {Many processes in science and engineering can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditionally, PDEs are derived by considering first principles of physics to derive the relations between the involved physical quantities of interest. A different approach is to measure the quantities of interest and use deep learning to reverse engineer the PDEs which are describing the physical process. In this paper we use machine learning, and deep learning in particular, to discover PDEs hidden in complex data sets from measurement data. We include examples of data from a known model problem, and real data from weather station measurements. We show how necessary transformations of the input data amounts to coordinate transformations in the discovered PDE, and we elaborate on feature and model selection. It is shown that the dynamics of a non-linear, second order PDE can be accurately described by an ordinary differential equation which is automatically discovered by our deep learning algorithm. Even more interestingly, we show that similar results apply in the context of more complex simulations of the Swedish temperature distribution.},

In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

abstract = {The modern synthesis of evolutionary biology unified Darwin's natural selection with Mendelian genetics, but at the same time it created the dilemma of genetic load. Lewontin and Hubby's (1966) and Harris's (1966) characterization of genetic variation in natural populations increased the apparent burden of this load. Neutrality or near neutrality of genetic variation was one mechanism proposed for the revealed excessive genetic variation. Bruce Wallace coined the term “soft selection” to describe an alternative way for natural selection to operate that was consistent with observed variation. He envisioned nature as presenting ecological vacancies that could be filled by diverse genotypes. Survival and successful reproduction was a combined function of population density, genotype, and genotype frequencies, rather than a fixed value of the relative fitness of each genotype. My goal in this review is to explore the importance of soft selection in the real world. My motive and that of my colleagues as described here is not to explain what maintains genetic variation in natural populations, but rather to understand the factors that shape how organisms adapt to natural environments. We characterize how feedbacks between ecology and evolution shape both evolution and ecology. These feedbacks are mediated by density- and frequency-dependent selection, the mechanisms that underlie soft selection. Here, I report on our progress in characterizing these types of selection with a combination of a consideration of the published literature and the results from my collaborators' and my research on natural populations of guppies.},

The connectivity of computation nodes was arranged in such a way that the previous community data have recurrent feedback. In concurrence with the input of biological data, corresponding sets of environmental data such as water velocity and depth, sedimented organic matter, and volume of small substrates were also provided for the network. Through the connectivity of the network, environmental data were used as input to produce continuous, independent effects on determining community abundance.

abstract = {In an era of rapid climate change, there is a pressing need to understand how organisms will cope with faster and less predictable variation in environmental conditions. Here we develop a unifying model that predicts evolutionary responses to environmentally driven fluctuating selection and use this theoretical framework to explore the potential consequences of altered environmental cycles. We first show that the parameter space determined by different combinations of predictability and timescale of environmental variation is partitioned into distinct regions where a single mode of response (reversible phenotypic plasticity, irreversible phenotypic plasticity, bet-hedging, or adaptive tracking) has a clear selective advantage over all others. We then demonstrate that, although significant environmental changes within these regions can be accommodated by evolution, most changes that involve transitions between regions result in rapid population collapse and often extinction. Thus, the boundaries between response mode regions in our model correspond to evolutionary tipping points, where even minor changes in environmental parameters can have dramatic and disproportionate consequences on population viability. Finally, we discuss how different life histories and genetic architectures may influence the location of tipping points in parameter space and the likelihood of extinction during such transitions. These insights can help identify and address some of the cryptic threats to natural populations that are likely to result from any natural or human-induced change in environmental conditions. They also demonstrate the potential value of evolutionary thinking in the study of global climate change.},

That is the population evolves ways (in this case, different genetic architecture for the trait) to cope with the environmental regime. 

- The study provides a nice plot of the different modality of adaptive responses given the environmental regime. In this sense, this paper provides a nice map to pin specific genetic architectures to environmental regimes. It is nice to formulate testable assumptions.

- Another interesting insight is that the shifts in environmental regimes can cause brutal changes in the genetic architecture of the adaptive response, and thus brutal shifts in the eco-evo dynamics.

- Yet, the model is highly phenomenological model (e.g. "plasiticity is assumed to be costly."). It does not account for actual feedbacks, it looks at evolutionary endpoints. It does not account for complete feedback archiectures either, as there are no population dynamics, no inter-specific interactions, genetic load is not accounted for etc.},

The implied feeding rates are consistent with independent measurements.

abstract = {In proposing his genetic feedback mechanism, David Pimentel was one of the first biologists to argue that the reciprocal interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an important process regulating population dynamics and ultimately affecting community composition. Although the past decade has seen an in- crease in research activity on these so-called eco-evolutionary dynamics, there remains a conspicuous lack of compelling natural ex- amples of such feedback. Here we argue that this lack may be due to an inherent difficulty in detecting eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. By examining models of virulence evolution, host resistance evolution, and antigenic evolution, we show that the influence of evolution on ecological dynamics can often be obscured by other ecological processes that yield similar dynamics.We then show, how- ever, that mechanistic models can be used to navigate this, in Pimentel's words, “devious” course of evolution when effectively com- bined with empirical data. We argue that these models, improving upon Pimentel's original mathematical models, will therefore play an increasingly important role in identifying more subtle, but possibly ubiquitous, eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. To highlight the importance of identifying these potentially subtle dynamics in nature, we end by considering our ability to anticipate the effect of popu- lation control strategies in the presence of these eco-evolutionary feedbacks.},

Ensembling NNs provides an easily implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.},

abstract = {Three drainage systems in British Columbia, Canada, contain divergent parapatric lake-stream pairs of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus): Drizzle and Mayer Lakes on Graham Island, Queen Charlotte Islands, and Misty Lake on northeastern Vancouver Island. Ecological and morphological differences between members of all three lake-stream pairs are strikingly similar; lake fish are melanistic and slim bodied with smaller mouths and more gill rakers than the mottled-brown and robust-bodied stream sticklebacks. We estimated the level of genetic divergence between lake and stream fish in Misty Lake and tested hypotheses of single versus multiple origins of the pairs by assaying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction site variation in samples from the three lake systems. MtDNA analysis revealed the existence of two highly divergent lineages differing by 2.7% in sequence. One lineage predom- inated in Misty stream fish (73%), whereas the other lineage predominated in Misty Lake samples (96%). Comparable forms (lake or stream) in the different lakes did not cluster together in terms of mtDNA nucleotide divergence, suggesting that the pairs have had independent origins. We concluded that: (1) divergent mtDNA lineages in North Pacific sticklebacks stem from historical isolation in the two major glacial refugia proposed for the North Pacific (Beringia and Cascadia); (2) the stream and lake pair in Misty Lake are distinct gene pools; (3) the divergence between parapatric lake and stream Gasterosteus represents parallel evolution having occurred at least twice in the North Pacific; and (4) different scales of evolutionary divergence exist in North Pacific Gasterosteus, that is, a relatively ancient divergence of mtDNA clades as well as recent (i.e., postglacial) divergence of ecotypes within major clades.},

abstract = {Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.},

Takeaway:
- the authors examplify the use of Bayesian ODE fitting to time series to recover ecological parameters of interest in a prey-predator chemostat system. 

Notes:
- The author state that they rely on HMC to fit their models while mentionning that the likelihood is evaluated numerically. I see that as a big problem and one that is not reasurring when it comes to the reliability of the work.
- The author use a hierarchical model to fit the model to different time series. I find this quite elegant.
- I find that the model fit are rubbish, which is a second point that advise caution.
- I realise that this is not completely novel, there have been applications of the method recently, it exists in other fields, the authors barely acknowledge this.
- The author fitted a deterministic ODE model to 18 different time series of the same system. They found variation in the vital rates across time series. They however only briefly conclude that it may be due to differences in phenotpyic structure of populations. Not more. 
- There are several key differences with your work on rotifer (1) the time series display more variations in dynamics, potentially in line with the fact that they did not use very similar populations (experiment performed over 7 years!), so not really true replicates in this sense, rather different populations; (2) they use only 2 species ; (3) they use a single parametric model, the fit of which is not even that good, which may be biasing a lot the results (dixit structural sensitivity), your approaches is non parametric and therefore better in this case ; (4) they do not really discuss that
- You can potentially position yourself by stating that this is close to a replicated system but not completely, what about populations that are actually almost identical?
- It seems that the time series come from different experiments, so technically not really replicates and differences in dynamics and dynamical processes are expected. The origin and differences among these time series is unclear and we cannot draw conclusions regarding the source of variability in dynamical processes. This is however a very interesting stepping stone to jump from.},

@article{Hairston2005,
abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator– prey interaction [Abrams, P. & Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. & Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr & Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.},
annote = {- Elegant framework - quite simple - they use the chain rule to compute contirbutions of times series on each other.

abstract = {An integrated pest management (IPM) system incorporating the introduction and field release of Diadegma semiclausum (Hell{\'{e}}n), a parasitoid of diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.), comprising the worst insect pest of the cabbage family, has been developed in Kenya to replace the pesticides-only approach. Mathematical modelling using differential equations has been used in theoretical studies of host-parasitoid systems. Although, this method helps in gaining an understanding of the system's dynamics, it is generally less accurate when used for prediction. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach was therefore chosen to aid prediction. The ANN methodology was applied to predict the population density of the DBM and D. semiclausum, its larval parasitoid. Two data sets, each from different release areas in the Kenya highlands, and both collected during a 3-year period after the release of the parasitoid, were used in the present study. Two ANN models were developed using these data. The ANN approach gave satisfactory results for DBM and for D. semiclausum. Sensitivity analysis suggested that pest populations may be naturally controlled by rainfall. The ANN provides a powerful tool for predicting host-parasitoid population densities and made few assumptions on the field data. The approach allowed the use of data collected at any appropriate scale of the system, bypassing the assumptions and uncertainties that could have occurred when parameters are imported from other systems. The methodology can be explored with respect to the development of tools for monitoring and forecasting the population densities of a pest and its natural enemies. In addition, the model can be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the natural enemies and to investigate augmentative biological control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

annote = {Takeaways:
- Need for more empirical evidence
- Complexity of natural systems hinders purely theoretical analysis, and they advocate for a hybrid research approach combining analysis of "live systems" through mathematical modelling.


Notes:
- The authors review cases/works where evolutionary dynamics are thought to influence demographic processes (population dynamics). I realise that actually this may be a small part of the dynamics that take place in natural systems. That feedbacks can arise from other pathways than simply through demographic effects.
- The authors propose to explore the soundness of the fitness gradient approach, and propose that unknown genetic architecture may be one of the main barriers to the success of such an approach. Actually, complex and unknown genetic architectures are not the sole hinderance to the applicability of such methods. Plasticity, and subtle combination of selective pressures are equally likely to make the approach irrelevent.
- The authors state that the start of using ODE eco-evolutionary models dates back to the 80s. With parameters in the ODE ecological model being driven by evolutionary equations.
- The authors point the need for accounting for species co-evolution and interactions. I see that this is still not done in natural systems today.
- The authors states that picturing coevolutionary dynamics between 3 speceis requires six equations, which prevents gaining a comprehensive overview of the dynamics through theory. I see this as useful for the introduction.
- Author point at the fact that Fortis took a hit because magnirostris and scandens decreased food suppplies. You should think about that as you do not account for reource depletion explicitly in your model. Though that can be accounted for in the direct inter-specific effects... 
- The authors provide a compelling list of empirical evidence for feedbcaks coming from prey-predator systems, host-parasite/parasitoid systems, ... This makes me realise that there is actually evidence for feedbacks at play. What is missing is more the quantification of those. Also most evidence is confined to experimental systems.
- Stress the need for more empirical evidence and for a combined mathematical and empirical approach.},

abstract = {Evolutionary and ecosystem dynamics are often treated as different processes --operating at separate timescales-- even if evidence reveals that rapid evolutionary changes can feed back into ecological interactions. A recent long-term field experiment has explicitly shown that communities of competing plant species can experience very fast phenotypic diversification, and that this gives rise to enhanced complementarity in resource exploitation and to enlarged ecosystem-level productivity. Here, we build on progress made in recent years in the integration of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and present a computational approach aimed at describing these empirical findings in detail. In particular we model a community of organisms of different but similar species evolving in time through mechanisms of birth, competition, sexual reproduction, descent with modification, and death. Based on simple rules, this model provides a rationalization for the emergence of rapid phenotypic diversification in species-rich communities. Furthermore, it also leads to non-trivial predictions about long-term phenotypic change and ecological interactions. Our results illustrate that the presence of highly specialized, non-competing species leads to very stable communities and reveals that phenotypically equivalent species occupying the same niche may emerge and coexist for very long times. Thus, the framework presented here provides a simple approach --complementing existing theories, but specifically devised to account for the specificities of the recent empirical findings for plant communities-- to explain the collective emergence of diversification at a community level, and paves the way to further scrutinize the intimate entanglement of ecological and evolutionary processes, especially in species-rich communities.},

abstract = {The relation of community structure to community function is the subject of much ecological theorizing. Three approaches to the problem, based on cybernetics, control theory, and niche theory, can be identified. They concur in giving biological interactions a major role in the determination of community structure in general, and species diversity in particular. To examine this body of theory, I use a "neutral" model for community development, a model which eliminates completely the biological interactions in question. Comparison of the patterns of community structure resulting from this model with the structure of natural communities provides an estimate of the effect of the biotic interactions. This can then be compared to the theoretically predicted effects. The neutral model used was originally developed in population genetics. In the context in which it is used here, it describes the stochastic development of a set of noninteracting populations, which colonize a community, persist temporarily, and eventually become extinct. The model predicts the form of the distribution of relative abundances and of species area curves, and sample values of species diversity. Comparisons of the model's predictions with actual community structure are made across what are taken to be gradients in the importance of biological interaction (successional vs. climax communities, high variation vs. low variation environments, the temperate zone vs. the tropics), using data on birds, fish, trees and insects. The results clearly contradict some of the theories of community structure. In those situations where biological interactions are predicted to generate the greatest increase in species diversity, the neutral model analysis shows that diversity is in fact significantly lower than would be expected in the absence of such interactions. Some implications of these findings for community theory are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent study of feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes has renewed interest in population regulation and density-dependent selection because they represent black-box descriptions of these feedbacks. The roles of population regulation and density-dependent selection in life-history evolution have received a significant amount of theoretical attention, but there are few empirical examples demonstrating their importance. We address this challenge in natural populations of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) that differ in their predation regimes. First, we tested whether natural populations of guppies are regulated by density dependence and quantified in which phases of the life cycle the effects of density are important. We found that guppies from low-predation (LP) environments are tightly regulated and that the density-dependent responses disproportionately affected some size classes. Second, we tested whether there are differences in density-dependent selection between guppies from LP or high-predation (HP) environments. We found that the fitness of HP guppies is more sensitive to the depressant effects of density than the fitness of LP guppies. Finally, we used an evolutionary invasion analysis to show that, depending on the effect of density on survival of the HP phenotype, this greater sensitivity of the HP phenotype to density can partially explain the evolution of the LP phenotype. We discuss the relevance of these findings to the study of feedbacks between ecology and evolution.},

1. Introduction
- Test effect of genetic variation on population dynamics in prey predator system

2. Methods
- Mathematical model (ODE) predicting shifts in population dynamics with genetic diversity in prey. (long cycles for diverse preys, short lotka-voltera cycles for clonal populations). Phenotype: trade off between competitivity and resistance to predation.
- Experimentally tested model prediction in microcosm. Manipulated prey genetic variation: population of a miture of small predator resistant preys (less competitive) and bigger less resistant preys, or clonal of either phenotype. And monitor population dynamics. Small phenotype is an evolutionary of the prey to exposure to the predator.

3. Results
- Find long cycles in polymorphic populations.
- Short cycles in oligomorphic populations.

4. Discussion
- Shows importance of phenotypic variation for population dynamics.
- Moreover as phenotype is obtained by an evolutionary response, and it implies shifts in genetic structure, results implies that fast evolutionary response can be a mechanism underlying observed population dynamics.
- YET, this is caused by changes in standing genetic variation, namely displacement of biomass on phenotypic axis, this is simply selection, a very restraint form of evolutionary response.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a dynamical theory of coevolution in ecological communities. The derivation explicitly accounts for the stochastic components of evolutionary change and is based on ecological processes at the level of the individual. We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

abstract = {We develop a method to identify how ecological, evolutionary, and eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence system stability. We apply our method to nine empirically parametrized eco-evolutionary models of exploiter-victim systems from the literature and identify which particular feedbacks cause some systems to converge to a steady state or to exhibit sustained oscillations. We find that ecological feedbacks involving the interactions between all species and evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving only the interactions between exploiter species (predators or pathogens) are typically stabilizing. In contrast, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving the interactions between victim species (prey or hosts) are destabilizing more often than not. We also find that while eco-evolutionary feedbacks rarely altered system stability from what would be predicted from just ecological and evolutionary feedbacks, eco-evolutionary feedbacks have the potential to alter system stability at faster or slower speeds of evolution. As the number of empirical studies demonstrating eco-evolutionary feedbacks increases, we can continue to apply these methods to determine whether the patterns we observe are common in other empirical communities.},
annote = {Takeaways:
- The authors provide a method for linking eco-evo feedbacks to the stability of different parts of the systems.
- They find that in most empirically parametrised models, eco-evo feedbacks do not alter the stability of the whole sytem, except in one model that is stabilised by eco-evo feedbacks. 
- Their method relies on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at equilibrium.
- They urge for new theory/frameworks to take on more complex systems.

Notes:
- The author raises the point that despite the increasing and sustained interst for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, very few studies actually addressed the potential dynamical consequences of feedbacks.
- The authors clarify feedback terminology by classifying feedbacks into "ecological", "evolutionary", and "eco-evolutionary". The importance of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks in driving system stability increases with evolutionary rates.
- The authors make the point that empirical evidence, in addition to being scarce, is not directly comparable across systems, due to changes in the speices and trait composition.
- The authors also stress the fact that most empirical systems are more complex than the simple systems addressed by theory. This implies a call for embracing complexity, as pointed out by Hendry 2019, van Benthem 2017, Brunner 2019.
- The two main points that I could critique are: (i) the application of the method is contingent on knowing the theory, i.e. the mechanisms that drive the different dynamics, which is challenging, if not impossible in complex systems; (ii) it relies on the assumption that the system is at equilibrium, which may be valid for the experimental simple systems considered in the empirical works addressed, but not in nature.You should reach out to them to developp another method.
- I sense in their vocabulary that the authors are trying to smooth some of the mathematical details of their framework, possibly with hope of making it more appealing to a larger body of eco-evolutionary biologists.
- The author propose the innovative idea of evaluating sub-system stability. In the context of the D-Finch, you can see that as the possibility for the eco-evolutionary dynamics to be at equilibrium, and the changes to be driven solely by environmental change. Partial stability.
- The authors show that eco-evo feedbacks affected the stability of the system in only one case.
- I understand that the results of this study are contingent on the system being at equilibrium. I personnally think that this condition is almost never achieved in nature. This makes me think back on a thought I had when I was working with Regis, which consisted in shifting my conceptual view of dynamical systems: if nothing is at equilibrium, maybe it is because everything is at dynamical equilibrium? Mathematically this allows you to solve ODE systems, and use the results as the model that should be fitted. This paper shows that this might deserve more thoughts.
- The authors stress the fact that effects of feedbacks on stability are contingent on the structure of the system (obviously), making it hard to draw general inferences.
- The author point at the need for experimental validation of these results, by maintaining experimental systems near equilibrium points.
- This sparks another thought regarding mechanism identifiabiilty: they consider theoretical models said to have been parametrised on real systems. The problem with this in general is that the theory is assumed a priori, and while their might be quantification of uncertainty on parameters (rarely actually), there is no quantification of the identifiability of the process. This is a major problem as the feedbacks inferred are fully determined by the supposed process.
- The authors make another point about the complexity of larger systems: e.g. system with 10 variables have 1023 subsystems... Which requires a novel kind of theoretical and modelling approach. My personnal understanding of this is that in order to draw inferences in larger, more complex systems, we have to sacrifice some of the realism that we have identified in smaller well studied systems. In fact, it is likely that because of the focus on simpler systems, we have developped a microscopic view of eco-evolutionary dynamics, we are trading some of the complexity in the process for complexity in the variables interactions. The new theory that is required can thus emerge from this microscopic view, and justifies a simplification of the processes considered (linear effects), to account for an increase in the complexity of the variables (i.e. the agents) at play.
- What I find surprising is that, while they point at the complexity of larger system being a challenge, they do not list the degree of knowledge of the processes as a caveat to their approach.},

@article{Pennell2017,
abstract = {The first American Naturalist appeared in March 1867. In a countdown to the 150th anniversary, the editors have solicited short commentaries on articles from the past that deserve a second look. Modern macroevolutionary thought is firmly rooted in the theories, models, and conventions of population biology. The most common mathematical models for describing long-term trait change, either along a phylogeny or paleontologi-cal time series, are formally the same as those that describe evolution within populations. And most of the hypotheses that we want to test with these and other models revolve around how species interactions—and competition, in particu-lar—shape patterns of diversity across deep time; think adap-tive radiations, coevolution, and diversity-dependent diversi-fication. As such, macroevolution and phylogenetic biology have been rather seamlessly incorporated into community ecology (phylogenetic community ecology, or ecophyloge-netics) and the emerging trait-based research program. There is a lot of exciting work happening now at the intersection of these fields; for example, there has been a recent burst of methods for more explicitly modeling character displacement in diversifying clades (e.g., Nuismer and Harmon, 2015, " Pre-dicting Rates of Interspecific Interaction from Phylogenetic Trees, " Ecology Letters 18:17–27). However, the interplay between macroevolution and ecol-ogy has been very limited in scope. Macroevolutionary bi-ologists have tended to synonymize ecology with community ecology, leaving the phylogenetics revolution isolated from whole fields of ecology. Chief among these is ecosystem ecol-ogy. Recently, researchers have started thinking about how the flow of energy and nutrients through ecological systems is related to the underlying population dynamics (e.g., Michel Loreau, 2010, From Populations to Ecosystems: Theoretical Foundations for a New Ecological Synthesis, Princeton Uni-versity Press, Princeton, NJ), but we have hardly even begun to consider how these system properties have evolved over long time periods. Remarkably, the possibility of such a project was proposed nearly 40 years ago by Joe Felsenstein, one of the key play-ers in the development of modern statistical macroevolution. In " Macroevolution in a Model Ecosystem, " published in The American Naturalist in 1978, Felsenstein invented a se-ries of nested models to explore how ecosystem properties change as lineages evolve and diversify. In the first model, energy flows through a population of identical individuals; then two genotypes with different energetic efficiencies com-pete in this population according to a simple, two-allele pop-ulation genetics model; then the distribution of energetic ef-ficiencies across a large number of lineages evolves over time (this is what Felsenstein refers to as macroevolution); then the environment changes such that optimizing energy effi-ciency comes with a risk; then Felsenstein incorporates tro-phic structure, such that energy is not lost from the system but is consumed by higher levels; and finally, he adds a mechanistic form of predation (or something resembling it), so that populations at lower levels do not increase without bound. The end result is a toy version of an ecosystem, in which the dynamics of the system are not only changing but evolving due to natural selection. Most remarkable is that his model suggests the possibility that the total energy con-tent of an ecosystem may be generally predicted by adap-tive evolution of energetic efficiencies. While undoubtedly creative, the article has been more or less ignored since its publication; it has been cited only four times as of February 2017 (Web of Knowledge), with three of those coming from outside of biology in journals like Dialectical Anthropology. (Felsenstein's 1985 work " Phy-logenies and the Comparative Method " is, in contrast, the second-most-cited paper in this journal's 150-year history.) However, perhaps this is understandable; the work's pre-science is not at all obvious. Indeed, its central conceit is that this is a rather silly thing to be writing about—something better suited to (very) late-night conversations at the pub than journal clubs. The paper opens with a discourse on exobiology},

Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract = {Evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.},

abstract = {It is widely thought that small populations should have less additive genetic variance and respond less efficiently to natural selection than large populations. Across taxa, we meta-analytically quantified the relationship between adult census population size (N) and additive genetic variance (proxy: h(2)) and found no reduction in h(2) with decreasing N; surveyed populations ranged from four to one million individuals (1735 h(2) estimates, 146 populations, 83 species). In terms of adaptation, ecological conditions may systematically differ between populations of varying N; the magnitude of selection these populations experience may therefore also differ. We thus also meta-analytically tested whether selection changes with N and found little evidence for systematic differences in the strength, direction or form of selection with N across different trait types and taxa (7344 selection estimates, 172 populations, 80 species). Collectively, our results (i) indirectly suggest that genetic drift neither overwhelms selection more in small than in large natural populations, nor weakens adaptive potential/h(2) in small populations, and (ii) imply that natural populations of varying sizes experience a variety of environmental conditions, without consistently differing habitat quality at small N. However, we caution that the data are currently insufficient to determine whether some small populations may retain adaptive potential definitively. Further study is required into (i) selection and genetic variation in completely isolated populations of known N, under-represented taxonomic groups, and nongeneralist species, (ii) adaptive potential using multidimensional approaches and (iii) the nature of selective pressures for specific traits.},

abstract = {Decades of theory and recent empirical results have shown that evolutionary, population, community and ecosystem properties are the result of feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. The vast majority of theory and empirical research on these eco-evolutionary feedbacks has focused on interactions among population size and mean traits of populations. However, numbers and mean traits represent only a fraction of the possible feedback dimensions. Populations of many organisms consist of different size classes that differ in their impact on the environment and each other. Moreover, rarely do we know the map of ecological pathways through which changes in numbers or size structure cause evolutionary change. The goal of this study was to test the role of size structure in eco-evolutionary feedbacks of Trinidadian guppies and to begin to build an eco-evolutionary map along this unexplored dimension. We used a factorial experiment in mesocosms wherein we crossed high- and low-predation guppy phenotypes with population size structure. We tested the ability of changes in size structure to generate selection on the demographic rates of guppies using an integral projection model (IPM). To understand how fitness differences among high- and low-predation phenotypes may be generated, we measured the response of the biomass of lower trophic levels and nutrient cycling to the different phenotype and size structure treatments. We found a significant interaction between guppy phenotype and the size structure treatments for absolute fitness. Size structure had a very large effect on invertebrate biomass in the mesocosms, but there was little or no effect of the phenotype. The effect of size structure on algal biomass depended on guppy phenotype, with no difference in algal biomass in populations with more, smaller guppies, but a large decrease in algal biomass in mesocosms with phenotypes adapted to low-predation risk. These results indicate an important role for size structure partially driving eco-evolutionary feedbacks in guppies. The changes in the ecosystem suggest that the absence of a steep decline in guppy fitness of the low-predation risk populations is likely due to higher consumption of algae when invertebrates are comparatively rare. Overall, these results demonstrate size structure as a possible dimension through which eco-evolutionary feedbacks may occur in natural populations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an initial attempt to learn evolution PDEs from data. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. The basic idea of the proposed PDE-Net is to learn differential operators by learning convolution kernels (filters), and apply neural networks or other machine learning methods to approximate the unknown nonlinear responses. Comparing with existing approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is known or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential operators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). We also discuss relations of the PDE-Net with some existing networks in computer vision such as Network-In-Network (NIN) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.},

This theory assumes that significant evolutionary change occurs over ecologically relevant timescales and that phenotypes have differential effects on the environment. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation causes ecosystem structure and function to diverge. We demonstrate that populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), characterized by differences in phenotypic and population-level traits, differ in their impact on ecosystem properties. We report results from a replicated, common garden mesocosm experiment and show that differences between guppy phenotypes result in the divergence of ecosystem structure (algal, invertebrate, and detrital standing stocks) and function (gross primary productivity, leaf decomposition rates, and nutrient flux). These phenotypic effects are further modified by effects of guppy density. We evaluated the generality of these effects by replicating the experiment using guppies derived from two independent origins of the phenotype. Finally, we tested the ability of multiple guppy traits to explain observed differences in the mesocosms. Our findings demonstrate that evolution can significantly affect both ecosystem structure and function. The ecosystem differences reported here are consistent with patterns observed across natural streams and argue that guppies play a significant role in shaping these ecosystems.},

abstract = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids); and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long-term population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {A method is presented to solve partial differential equations (pde's) and its boundary and/or initial conditions by using neural networks. It uses the fact that multiple input, single output, single hidden layer feedforward networks with a linear output layer with no bias are capable of arbitrarily well approximating arbitrary functions and its derivatives, which is proven by a number of authors and well known in literature. Knowledge about the pde and its boundary and/or initial conditions is incorporated into the structures and the training sets of several neural networks. In this way we obtain networks of which some are specifically structured. To find the solution of the pde and its boundary and/or initial conditions we have to train all obtained networks simultaneously. Therefore we use an evolutionary algorithm to train the networks. We demonstrate the working of our method by applying it to two problems.},

- The difference with your work is that they approximate the solution to the differential equation with a neural network, instead of the differential equation itself. More specifically, they assume the equation and the boundary conditions are known. They train the networks to reproduce boundary conditions. This implies that the network approximates the solution to the pde in the set.

The genetics and genomics of these /`eco-evolutionary dynamics/' will be[mdash]to a large extent[mdash]the genetics and genomics of organismal phenotypes. In the hope of stimulating research in this area, I review empirical data from natural populations and draw the following conclusions. (1) Considerable additive genetic variance is present for most traits in most populations. (2) Trait correlations do not consistently oppose selection. (3) Adaptive differences between populations often involve dominance and epistasis. (4) Most adaptation is the result of genes of small-to-modest effect, although (5) some genes certainly have larger effects than the others. (6) Adaptation by independent lineages to similar environments is mostly driven by different alleles/genes. (7) Adaptation to new environments is mostly driven by standing genetic variation, although new mutations can be important in some instances. (8) Adaptation is driven by both structural and regulatory genetic variation, with recent studies emphasizing the latter. (9) The ecological effects of organisms, considered as extended phenotypes, are often heritable. Overall, the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics will benefit from perspectives and approaches that emphasize standing genetic variation in many genes of small-to-modest effect acting across multiple traits and that analyze overall adaptation or /`fitness/'. In addition, increasing attention should be paid to dominance, epistasis and regulatory variation.},

- Eco-evolutionary dynamics is the name of the field
- This field is growing rapidly and recently
- Phenotype is the coupling between ecology and evolution
- Most effort should look at the genomic basis of eco-evolutionary dynamics
- Main response to selection should come from standing genetic variation
- Genetic correlations unlikely to swamp evolutionary change (because (i) phenotypes are high dimensional, (ii) correlations can also be positive and thus speeding up evolution hence evening things out)
- Non-additive variation is important => consider gene interactions
- Eco-evo dynamics should mostly involve highly polygenic structures (because the phenotype that ultimately determines the fitness is high dimensional)
- Distributions of effect size should be numerous-small to scarce-strong effects with more emphasis on the numerous-small end of the spectrum
- Hard to disentangle the importance of mutations and standing genetic variation in driving population evolutionary response => depends on the biology of the species / environmental context in intricate ways...
[WILL] would be interesting to investigate this... 
- response to selection likely to involve both structural and regulatory changes (change the arrows and buttons in the gene regulatory network).
- Heritability is likely to constrain evolutionary dynamics but not know how it is controlled [WILL] Also a nice area for investigation (e.g. how does environmental stochasticity affect heritability...)

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics are now recognized to be highly relevant for population and community dynamics. However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {Feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary change may play important roles in community and ecosystem functioning, but a complete eco-evolutionary feedback loop has not been demonstrated at the community level, and we know little about molecular mechanisms underlying this kind of eco-evolutionary dynamics. In predator-prey (rotifer-alga) microcosms, cyclical changes in predator abundance generated fluctuating selection for a heritable prey defence trait, cell clumping. Predator population growth was affected more by prey evolution than by changes in prey abundance, and changes in predator abundance drove further prey evolution, completing the feedback loop. Within a predator-prey cycle, genes up-regulated as clumping declined were down-regulated as clumping increased, and vice-versa. Genes changing most in expression tended to be associated with defence or its cost. Expression patterns of individual genes differed greatly between consecutive cycles (often reversing direction), suggesting that a particular phenotype may be produced by several (perhaps many) different gene transcription pathways.},
annote = {Takeaway
- "direct" evidence for feedback effects. Clumb size affects the growth rate of the predator. The predator density affect the growth rate of the prey (not demonstrated in the study though).
- They show that the pattern of gene expression varies across cycles. This means that the dynamics of the traits are governed by highly complex genetic pathways, which are inconsistent in time.

Note
- I still see that as qualitative evidence. The complete feedback is not demonstrated.
- Might be a good paper to use in your introduction as an example of eco-evo feedback.
- This article makes me think that redundancy in the pathways for phenotypic change may be one mechanism to maintain genetic variation.

1. Introduction
- Genomics + observing fast evolution => set the possibility to dissect microscopic structure of evolution with ecological time series. 

2. Methods
- Experimental microcosm in lab (rotifer algal system).
- Trait is algae clumping up to resist predators, but reduce amount of nitrogen they receive individually.
- Monitor populations densities, and expression of annotated gene sequences + correlation with trait expression.
- Evolution (trait change) contributes to ecological dynamics.

3. Results
- Theoretical predictions match observed dynamics in the lab.
- Gene expression underlying phenotype expression changes from one cycle to the next despite same trait and population dynamics...


4. Discussion
- although genetic structure is identified, gene expression changes in opposite manner from one cycle to the next.
- Could be due to changes in allele densities, and/or, changes in expression level of regulatory elements.
- Should be more complex in nature... need to understand under what circumstances eco-evo feedbacks arise.

5. Comments:
- would be a nice data set to test models on.
- shows that genotype phenotype map may change... => (i) reinforces the need for controlling eco-evo dynamics when studying genotype phenotype maps. => (ii) scary because means that the genetic architecture of eco-evo feedbacks may change on the fly.},

abstract = {Climatic change has frequently been identified as a key driver of change in biological communities. These changes can take the form of alterations to population dynamics, phenotypic characters, genetics and the life history of organisms and can have impacts on entire ecosystems. This study presents a novel investigation of how changes in a large scale climatic index, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can influence population dynamics and phenotypic characters in a population of ungulates. We use an integral projection model combined with actual climate change predictions to project future body size distributions for a population of Soay sheep Ovis aries. The climate change predictions used to direct our model projections were taken from published results of climate models, covering a range of different emissions scenarios. Our model results showed that for positive changes in the mean NAO large population declines occurred simultaneously with increases in mean body weight. The exact direction and magnitude of changes to population dynamics and character distributions were dependent on the greenhouse gas emissions scenario and model used to predict the NAO. This study has demonstrated how integral projection models can use outputs of climate models to direct projections of population dynamics and phenotypic character distributions. This approach allows the results of this study to be placed within current climate change research. The nature of integral projection models means that this methodology can be easily applied to other populations. The model can also be easily updated when new climate change predictions become available, making it a useful tool for understanding potential population level responses to climatic change. Synthesis Understanding how changes in climate affect biological communities is a key component in predicting the future form of populations. Utilising a novel approach that incorporates climatic drivers (in this instance the winter North Atlantic Oscillation) into an integral projection model framework, we predict future Soay sheep dynamics under specific climate change scenarios. Tracking quantitative trait distributions and life history metrics, our results predict declining population size and increasing body weight for an increasingly positive winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, as predicted by climate models. This has important implications for future wildlife management strategies and linking demographic responses to climate change.},
annote = {Notes
- most predictions of effect of climate change on populations comes from phenomenological models which do not incorporate the possibility for a change of the mechanism driving the effect of climate change.

- many reports of changes in size with climate change, and size affects population dynamics => including body size is important to study climate change.

- IPMs a suitable tools for studying impact of climate change on size structured populations.

- IPM predicts that positive NAO will favor smaller population sizes and heavier individuals, unravelling the potential for a link between individual traits, population dynamics, and climate change.

- Compact modelling approach.

- climate change creates unsuitable environment conditions => demography may decrease => genetic bottleneck => decreases evolvability of population and hence chances of responding to climate change.

- However model did not provide mechanism, did not account for spatial processes (dispersal), ecological processes (no competition, no predation), and did not tackle global warming (only inter-annual variability).},

We focus on the ecology and evolution of bacteriophage-resistance as a case study demonstrating the relationship between specific genes, individual interactions, population dynamics, community structure, and evolutionary change. In laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage, bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophage infection. Different resistance mutations produce distinct resistance phenotypes, differing, for example, in whether resistance is partial or complete, in the magnitude of the physiological cost associated with resistance, and in whether the mutation can be countered by a host-range mutation in the bacteriophage. These differences determine whether a mutant can invade, the effect its invasion has on the population dynamics of sensitive bacteria and phage, and the resulting structure of the community. All of these effects, in turn, govern the community's response to environmental change and its subsequent evolution.},

Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species' life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow.

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Models are useful when they are compared with data. Whether this comparison should be qualitative or quantitative depends on circumstances, but in many cases some statistical comparison of model and data is useful and enhances objectivity. Unfortunately, ecological dynamic models tend to contain assumptions and simplifications that enhance tractability, promote insight, but spoil model fit, and this can cause difficulties when adopting a statistical approach. Furthermore, the arcane numerical analysis required to fit dynamic models reliably presents an impediment to objective model testing by fitting. This paper presents methods for formulating and fitting partially specified models, which aim to achieve a measure of generality by avoiding some of the irrelevant incidental assumptions that are inevitable in more traditional approaches. This is done by allowing delay differential equation models, difference equation models, and differential equation models to be constructed with part of their structure represented by unknown functions, while part of the structure may contain conventional model elements that contain only unknown parameters. An integrated practical methodology for using such models is presented along with several examples, which include use of models formulated using delay differential equations, discrete difference equations/matrix models, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations. The methods also allow better estimation from ecological data by model fitting, since models can be formulated to include fewer unjustified assumptions than would usually be the case if more traditional models were used, while still including as much structure as the modeler believes can be justified by biological knowledge: model structure improves precision, while fewer extraneous assumptions reduce unquantifiable bias.},

abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly being used in science to infer hidden dynamics of natural systems from noisy observations, a task typically handled by hierarchical models in ecology. This article describes a class of hierarchical models parameterised by neural networks – neural hierarchical models. The derivation of such models analogises the relationship between regression and neural networks. A case study is developed for a neural dynamic occupancy model of North American bird populations, trained on millions of detection/non-detection time series for hundreds of species, providing insights into colonisation and extinction at a continental scale. Flexible models are increasingly needed that scale to large data and represent ecological processes. Neural hierarchical models satisfy this need, providing a bridge between deep learning and ecological modelling that combines the function representation power of neural networks with the inferential capacity of hierarchical models.},

Coexistence theory for two competing species posits that intraspecific density dependence should be stronger than interspecific density dependence. Great tits and blue tits are two bird species that compete for food resources and nesting cavities. On the basis of long-term monitoring of these two competing species at sites across Europe, combining observational and manipulative approaches, we show that the strength of density regulation is similar for both species, and that individuals have contrasting abilities to compete depending on their age. For great tits, density regulation is driven mainly by intraspecific competition. In contrast, for blue tits, interspecific competition contributes as much as intraspecific competition, consistent with asymmetric competition between the two species. In addition, including age-specific effects of intra- and interspecific competition in density-dependence models improves predictions of fluctuations in population size by up to three times.},

abstract = {I n 1831 the manager of a Hudson's Bay Company post in northern Ontario wrote to the head office in London. The local Ojibway Indians were starving,he reported,because of a scarcity of “rabbits,”and they were unable to trap for furs because they spent all their time fishing for food (Winter- halder 1980). These shortages of so-called rabbits,which ap- parently occurred approximately every 10 years, are regularly mentioned in Canadian historical documents from the 18th and 19th centuries.Those rabbits were in fact snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), and their 10-year cycle is one of the most intriguing features of the ecology of the boreal forest. Ten-year cycles were first analyzed quantitatively when wildlife biologists began to plot the fur trading records of Hudson's Bay Company during the early 1900s. The Hud- son's Bay Company, established in 1671, kept meticulous records of the numbers of furs traded from different posts spread across Canada. The most famous time series drawn together from those records was that of Canada lynx (Elton and Nicholson 1942; Figure 1).The lynx is a specialist preda- tor of snowshoe hares, and the rise and fall in lynx numbers mirrors,with a slight time lag, the rise and fall of snowshoe hare populations across the boreal region. The spectacular cycles of snowshoe hares and their preda- tors have captured the attention of biologists as well as his- torians. These cycles are highlighted in virtually all ecology texts and are often cited as one of the few examples of Lotka-Volterra predator–prey equations, a simple model which shows never-ending oscillations in the numbers of predators and their prey.Cycles seem to violate the implicit assumption of many ecologists that there is a balance in na- ture, and anyone living in the boreal forest would be hard pressed to recognize a balance among the boom and bust in nature's economy.The challenge to biologists has been to un- derstand the mechanisms behind these cycles,which has not been easy. One cycle lasts 10 years, and few PhD students or researchers wish to take 10 years to obtain n = 1. Fortunately, over the last 40 years ecologists working in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, and Alaska have put together an array of studies that have resolved most, but not all, of the enigmas behind these cycles (Keith 1990, Boutin et al. 1995). To understand any fluctuating population,one must first know in detail the mechanisms of changes in births, deaths, and movements that are the proximate causes of the changes in numbers. Before we describe these details, we should note that these 10-year hare cycles tend to occur in synchrony across broad regions. Indeed, hares across most of Canada and Alaska reached a peak in 1997–1999 during the most re- cent cycle.We explain the reasons behind this synchrony be- low, but let us note here that movements of hares cannot explain these population changes via immigration or emi- gration.Movements on a local level might be important,but at the regional level all populations rise and fall in unison. Population changes must be driven by changes in births and deaths.},
annote = {- the lynx is specialist of the snowshoe hare (that is also said by Stenseth 2001)
- Reproduction of the hare is maximum in the increase and minimum in the decline phase (as shown in Stenseth 2001)
- Hare survival is roughly the inverse of the lynx peak (we see in the article that it is indeed driven by predators)
- Unlikely that running out of food is an explanation for the drop in reproduction and survival (as in Stenseth 2001). Food quality neither does explain the snwoshoe cycle.
- Both lynx and coyotes killed more hare during decline phase (as in Stenseth 2001).
- Food addition + predation exclusion improve reproduction of hare.
- Likely that more food has an indirect (rather than direct) effect on the cycle, in that higher food levels would reduce indirect effect of increased predation pressure (e.g. better resistance to stress)
- Indirect effects of food and direct effects of predation are the main drivers of the decline in the snowshoe hare, thus predation.},

abstract = {Adaptive variation in the traits determining ecological interactions can lead to evolution so rapid that ecological dynamics change course while in progress (i.e., 'eco-evolutionary dynamics'). However, little is known about how the qualitative properties of eco-evolutionary dynamics (e.g., cycling, equilibrium, etc.) are affected by the amount of heritable variation present. Here, we show that a change in the range of variation in a heritable prey defense trait determines what dynamics are observed in an experimental predator-prey system. We combine modelling and laboratory experiments to show that initial defense trait variation determines whether populations exhibit eco-evolutionary cycles in which heritable variation is maintained, or converge to an equilibrium at which the prey population becomes monomorphic. Our results show how small changes in the amount of adaptive genetic variance initially present can radically alter eco-evolutionary dynamics, and can ultimately determine whether heritable variation is maintained or lost.},

Here, we review the evolutionary and population-level consequences of such mismatches and how these depend on other ecological factors, such as additional drivers of selection and density-dependent recruitment. This review puts the research on phenological mismatches into a conceptual framework, applies this framework beyond consumer–resource interactions and illustrates this framework using examples drawn from the vast body of literature on mismatches.

abstract = {The ability to intercept uncooperative targets is key to many diverse flight behaviors, from courtship to predation. Previous research has looked for simple geometric rules describing the attack trajectories of animals, but the underlying feedback laws have remained obscure. Here, we use GPS loggers and onboard video cameras to study peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, attacking stationary targets, maneuvering targets, and live prey. Weshow that the terminal attack trajectories of peregrines are not described by any simple geometric rule as previously claimed, and instead use system identification techniques to fit a phenomenological model of the dynamical system generating the observed trajectories. We find that these trajectories are best - and exceedingly well - modeled by the proportional navigation (PN) guidance law used by most guided missiles. Under this guidance law, turning is commanded at a rate proportional to the angular rate of the line-of-sight between the attacker and its target, with a constant of proportionality (i.e., feedback gain) called the navigation constant (N). Whereas most guided missiles use navigation constants falling on the interval 3 < N < 5, peregrine attack trajectories are best fitted by lower navigation constants (median N < 3). This lower feedback gain is appropriate at the lower flight speed of a biological system, given its presumably higher error and longer delay. This same guidance law could find use in small visually guided drones designed to remove other drones from protected airspace.},

abstract = {Population dynamic modelling often entails parameterizing quite sophisticated biological and ecological mechanisms. For models of moderate mechanistic complexity, this has traditionally been done in an ad hoc manner, with different parameters being estimated independently. The point estimates so obtained are then used for model simulation, perhaps with some further ad hoc adjustment based on comparison with any available data on population dynamics. Quantitative assessments of model adequacy and prediction uncertainty are not easily made using this approach. As an alternative, the paper investigates the practical feasibility of fitting a moderately complex population dynamic model directly and simultaneously to all the data available for parameterization of the model, and to all available data on the population dynamics of the target animal. This alternative approach allows us to combine all available quantitative information on the target species, to assess the viability of the model, the mutual consistency of model and different sources of data and to estimate the uncertainties that are associated with model-based predictions. The target organism in this study is the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex (L.), which we model using a stage-structured population dynamic model, implemented via a set of delay differential equations describing the basic demography of the population. Target data include population dynamic data from two sites, information on basic physiological relationships and environmental temperature data. Fitting is performed by using a non-linear least squares approach supplemented with a bootstrapping method for avoiding small scale local minima in the least squares objective function. Variance estimation is performed by further bootstrapping. Interest in Gammarus pulex population dynamics in this case is primarily related to likely population level responses to chemical stressors, and for this we examine predicted 'recovery times' following exposure to a known toxicant. {\textcopyright} 2006 Royal Statistical Society.},

- They state that fitting to the complete dataset makes parameters more identifiable, and that the traditional approach increases the range of possibilities by ignoring inter-dependences between parameters.
- They still highlight problems with underfitting and overfitting some time series which is due to making a compromise between the two locations. I see that as a problem because you do not accurately describe the dynamics of each system well then... One possible reason is precisely because generalisation is not possible.
- In the end the paper might be useful to show that fitting globally across replicates may not lead to optimal results because generalisation is tricky in natural populations. You can hence use it as an example of non-generalisation.},

Combining experiments with an algal host and its viral parasite, and mathematical model analyses we show eco-evolutionary dynamics in antagonistic coevolving populations. The interaction between antagonists initially resulted in arms race dynamics (ARD) with selective sweeps, causing oscillating host–virus population dynamics. However, ARD ended and populations stabilised after the evolution of a general resistant host, whereas a trade-off between host resistance and growth then maintained host diversity over time (trade-off driven dynamics). Most importantly, our study shows that the interaction between ecology and evolution had important consequences for the predictability of the mode and tempo of adaptive change and for the stability and adaptive potential of populations.

- This paper is also the first to address empirically and theoretically co-evolution.

- They modelled the system in an individual-based framework. Quite simple.

- An interesting bit is that they propose that selective sweeps can actually erode genetic diversity and constrain residual adaptive potential of population. This leads to the interesting idea that the outcome of co-evolution depends on the initial genetic diversity in each populations, as the virus falls out of options quite fast.

- This is another way that feedbacks might alter the dynamics of systems. Namely not just because they produce an interplay between ecology and evolution, but also because it can diminish adaptability.},

abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

We also demonstrate that this trend towards maturation at younger ages and smaller sizes is halted and even shows signs of reversal during the closure of the fisheries. In addition, our analysis reveals that males tend to mature earlier and at a smaller size than females and that maturation age and size decrease with increasing latitude. Importantly, the maturation reaction norms presented here are robust to variation in survival and growth (through phenotypic plasticity) and are thus strongly indicative of rapid evolutionary changes in cod maturation as well as of spatial and sex-specific genetic variation. We therefore suggest that maturation reaction norms can provide helpful reference points for managing harvested populations with evolving life histories.},

abstract = {Environmental change has been observed to generate simultaneous responses in population dynamics, life history, gene frequencies, and morphology in a number of species. But how common are such eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change likely to be? Are they inevitable, or do they require a specific type of change? Can we accurately predict eco-evolutionary responses? We address these questions using theory and data from the study of Yellowstone wolves. We show that environmental change is expected to generate eco-evolutionary change, that changes in the average environment will affect wolves to a greater extent than changes in how variable it is, and that accurate prediction of the consequences of environmental change will probably prove elusive.},
annote = {Notes:
- I see that there is a need for quantifying feedback as they play out directly in the time series.
- The IPM reproduces well the dynamics of the wolf population, which implies that an interplay between genetic structure, phenotype distribution, and population dynamics are necessary to correctly predict change sin natrual populations. That being said, the model does not explore explicitly environmental variation impacts population dynamics, that is how changes in other components of the ecosystems impact changes in the population.
- Another thing that IPMs cannot bring is a dissection of sources of change as the dynamics play out, which goes back to the comment that I made above on the need to quantify effects as they play out.
- The authors demonstrate that environmental perturbations can be achieved by changing intercepts of rate functions (the unaccounted variation). They show that only a mean directional change has an impact on the biological properties of the model. This rejoins the results found in the D-Finch, which suggest that directional environmental change is likely to be one main effective mechanism for driving evolutionary change.
- The authors actually point at the fact that they do not identify the drivers of environmentally mediated changes. This rejoins my comment on why we may need an approach that accounts fotr more environmental variables (i.e. more ecosystem components) dissects those effects as they play out.
- I understand that IPMs are a powerful way to decompose the interplay between demography, phenotypic change, and its underlying genetic structure from individual level data. I also understand that we are also far off integrating them dynamically with changes in other components of the system as several steps are required before that: (i) the inference has to be made to encompass real time changes in the time series; (ii) IPMs have then to be merged with other models predicting changes in the other components of the ecosystem (e.g. ODEs). I can hence see the need for an integrative mathematical framework which would demonstrate how to go from ODE to PDEs and from there to IPMs, all of that within an integrated bayesian framework. I also suspect that giving up on population structure might be one of the first compromise that we have to make if we are to incorporate more complex ecosytem effects, for instance by bringing potential feedbacks with other species, and resources. These effects are potentially as important as those stemming from population structure modelled in IPMs.

abstract = {Electronically published XX abstract: Heritable phenotypic traits under significant and con-sistent directional selection often fail to show the expected evolu-tionary response. A potential explanation for this contradiction is that because environmental conditions change constantly, environ-mental change can mask an evolutionary response to selection. We combined an " animal model " analysis with 36 years of data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major) to explore selection on and evolution of a morphological trait: body mass at fledging. We found significant heritability of this trait, but despite consistent pos-itive directional selection on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component of body mass, the population mean phenotypic value declined rather than increased over time. However, the mean breeding value for body mass at fledging increased over time, pre-sumably in response to selection. We show that the divergence be-tween the response to selection observed at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by a change in environmental con-ditions over time, that is, related both to increased spring temperature before breeding and elevated population density. Our results support the suggestion that measuring phenotypes may not always give a reliable impression of evolutionary trajectories and that understand-ing patterns of phenotypic evolution in nature requires an under-standing of how the environment has itself changed. A major aim of evolutionary biology is to understand how the combination of genetic variation and natural selection produces evolutionary change and thus adaptation. If se-lection acts consistently on a heritable trait, the mean value of the trait is expected to change over time (Falconer and MacKay 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998). However, several studies of natural populations have documented both di-rectional selection and additive genetic variation for a given trait but have found no evidence of the expected microevolutionary change (sometimes even a change in the opposite direction) in the population mean phenotype over time (for a review, see Meril{\"{a}} et al. 2001b). These findings stand in contrast with the otherwise overwhelm-ing evidence of natural selection and adaptation docu-mented in the wild (for reviews, see Endler 1986; King-solver et al. 2001; Kinnison and Hendry 2001). An implicit assumption of any study using long-term data sets to assess microevolutionary change over time is that the environment in which individuals are measured remains constant over the study period. However, Cooke et al. (1990) first suggested that if the environment changes at the same time as the presumed evolutionary changes (e.g., through negative density-dependent processes), then it is possible that a genetic response to selection on a given trait might be masked by opposing changes in the envi-ronmental component of that trait. Cooke et al. (1990) argued that this effect might be responsible for the lack of evolutionary response observed for clutch size in lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens) despite positive directional selection and significant heritability. They suggested that if a given population were restricted to a limited area, then environmental factors such as negative density-dependent processes would tend to have a negative impact on the trait under investigation despite the fact that the mean breeding value (or additive genetic merit) of the trait were increasing. For instance, selection on a trait implies that some individuals with particular values of the trait have higher reproductive success and thus produce more off-spring, which will tend to resemble their parents. These offspring will subsequently occupy mostly the same habitat and will be subject to the same form of selection as their},
annote = {1. Introduction

- pb: microevolution in real time often studied in constant environments => no eco-evo feedback possible. The change in evnironmental conditions caused by response to selection can conceal evolution.
- Still not many evidence of that in a wild context.

2. Methods

(i) Q genetics
- computed estimated breeding values for each generations (BLUPs) to approximate the additive genetic component of the phenotype
- logistic regression of relative survival (fitness) with (i) std phenotype and (ii) breeding values. To quantify selection differential (i.e. the direction and strength of selection) on the phenotype and the additive genetic component. For each year.
- Break the residual variance into environmental components (more BLUPs)

(ii) System 
- Model: Great tit system 
- trait: body mass at fledging
- Study time: 38 years time series

3. Results

- trait is heritable
- positive selection on it
- trait value decreases across the study despite positive selection
- yet the breeding value increases

4. Discussion

- Demonstration of an eco-evo feedback 
- Changes in environment mask microevolution},

abstract = {The extinction vortex is a theoretical model describing the process by which extinction risk is elevated in small, isolated populations owing to interactions between environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. However, empirical demonstrations of these interactions have been elusive. We modelled the dynamics of a small mountain lion population isolated by anthropogenic barriers in greater Los Angeles, California, to evaluate the influence of demographic, genetic, and landscape factors on extinction probability. The population exhibited strong survival and reproduction, and the model predicted stable median population growth and a 15% probability of extinction over 50 years in the absence of inbreeding depression. However, our model also predicted the population will lose 40-57% of its heterozygosity in 50 years. When we reduced demographic parameters proportional to reductions documented in another wild population of mountain lions that experienced inbreeding depression, extinction probability rose to 99.7%. Simulating greater landscape connectivity by increasing immigration to greater than or equal to one migrant per generation appears sufficient to largely maintain genetic diversity and reduce extinction probability. We provide empirical support for the central tenet of the extinction vortex as interactions between genetics and demography greatly increased extinction probability relative to the risk from demographic and environmental stochasticity alone. Our modelling approach realistically integrates demographic and genetic data to provide a comprehensive assessment of factors threatening small populations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Habitat fragmentation increasingly threatens the services provided by natural communities and ecosystem worldwide. An understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes underlying fragmentation-compromised communities in natural settings is lacking, yet critical to realistic and sustainable conservation. Through integrating the multivariate genetic, biotic and abiotic facets of a natural community module experiencing various degrees of habitat fragmentation, we provide unique insights into the processes underlying community functioning in real, natural conditions. The focal community module comprises a parasitic butterfly of conservation concern and its two obligatory host species, a plant and an ant. We show that both historical dispersal and ongoing habitat fragmentation shape population genetic diversity of the butterfly Phengaris alcon and its most limited host species (the plant Gentiana pneumonanthe). Genetic structure of each species was strongly driven by geographical structure, altitude and landscape connectivity. Strikingly, however, was the strong degree of genetic costructure among the three species that could not be explained by the spatial variables under study. This finding suggests that factors other than spatial configuration, including co-evolutionary dynamics and shared dispersal pathways, cause parallel genetic structure among interacting species. While the exact contribution of co-evolution and shared dispersal routes on the genetic variation within and among communities deserves further attention, our findings demonstrate a considerable degree of genetic parallelism in natural meta-communities. The significant effect of landscape connectivity on the genetic diversity and structure of the butterfly also suggests that habitat fragmentation may threaten the functioning of the community module on the long run.},

Adaptive dynamics so far has been put on a rigorous footing only for direct competition models (Lotka-Volterra models) involving a competition kernel which describes the competition pressure from one individual to another one. We extend this to a multi-resources chemostat model, where the competition between individuals results from the sharing of several resources which have their own dynamics. Starting from a stochastic birth and death process model, we prove that, when advantageous mutations are rare, the population behaves on the mutational time scale as a jump process moving between equilibrium states (the polymorphic evolution sequence of the adaptive dynamics literature). An essential technical ingredient is the study of the long time behavior of a chemostat multi-resources dynamical system. In the small mutational steps limit this process in turn gives rise to a differential equation in phenotype space called canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. From this canonical equation and still assuming small mutation steps, we prove a rigorous characterization of the evolutionary branching points. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Disruptive natural selection within populations exploiting different resources is considered to be a major driver of adaptive radiation and the production of biodiversity. Fitness functions, which describe the relationships between trait variation and fitness, can help to illuminate how this disruptive selection leads to population differentiation. However, a single fitness function represents only a particular selection regime over a single specified time period (often a single season or a year), and therefore might not capture longer-term dynamics. Here, we build a series of annual fitness functions that quantify the relationships between phenotype and apparent survival. These functions are based on a 9-year mark-recapture dataset of over 600 medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) within a population bimodal for beak size.We then relate changes in the shape of these functions to climate variables. We find that disruptive selection between small and large beak morphotypes, as reported previously for 2 years, is present throughout the study period, but that the intensity of this selection varies in association with the harshness of environment. In particular, we find that disruptive selection was strongest when precipitation was high during the dry season of the previous year. Our results shed light on climatic factors associatedwith disruptive selection in Darwin's finches, and highlight the role of temporally varying fitness functions in modulating the extent of population differentiation.},
annote = {Takeaway:
- the strength of disruptive selection varies in time, and seems to be influenced by climatic change (rainfall).
- this might be one of the mechanisms maintaining genetic variation in natural studies.
- This justifies a dynamical integrative studies.
- I see that the drivers of this variation are still very unclear, in addition, it is unknown how that tranlates int demographic change.

Note:
- the author find that the shape of the fitness functions varies throughout years in line with rainfall, wetter years previous create stronger selection. They claim that this supports temporal variation in fitness functions. My understanding is that the fitness function itself deos not change, but the states/conditions influencing fitness change, which creates apparently different fitness functions throughout years.
- The finding of the authors are further interesting as this links to the study by grant and grant 2000, where they highlighted variations in the link between beak size and lnogevity throuhgout 3 generations, in line with environmental effects. The study of the authors thus confirms these results. I understand that overall, the relationship between beak size, the phentoype and demography may be more complicated than anticipated.
- The authors stress the fact that simple factors such as rainfall are already accounting for potentially a substantial amount of variation in selection throughout years. You can use that to support the inclusion of direct effects of rain on all variables.
- Again the authors point at the importance of "intrinsic dynamics" and density dependence, and extrinsic effectors in driving changes in fitness throughout years. I do not agree in the fact that these change the fitness functions, they may change the shape of the function, of the fitness landscape, the function itself is not changed, it is just evaluated at a different point. Still you can use this to justifiy a dynamically integrated approach to account for dynamical changes in selection.
- The authors state that body and beak morphology is highly polygenic. I realise that this a sufficient mechanism to maintain genetic diversity in natural populations. 
- They model fitness as apparent survival. I see that this is a much less thorough measure than that used in Grant and Grant 2000.
- Also their fitting technique is odd, they fit a GLM between the two peaks identified by the GAMs.
- The authors show that higher rainfall levels increase the strength of disruptive selection, which seems inconsistent with the grant studies.
- The authors stress the fact that the analysis of effects of climate on disruptive seleciton is exploratory, and does not stand for a formal testing of an effect of climate, nor identification of the relationship. Indeed, they do not explicitly test effects of rainfall, instead they compare regression slopes across years and wet/dry season.
- The authors hypothesise that the effects of rainfall o survival are mediated by competition, which introduces a lag in the effects, which is apparent only the following year. I do not find that particularly convincing, the statistical analysis is indirect, the range of data spanned limited. This merely hints at climatic effects, just like the study of Grant and Grant in 2000.
- The authors propse that the disruptive seleciton that they report here contributes to maintaing genetic variation in the finch.
- The authors point at an interesting theoretical prospect which is to link the observation of short term variation in selection to adaptive raditions, which operate over geological timescales. I see this as a very interesting challenge, though I think that before we are ready to perform this step there is mouch much more to learn about eco-evolutionary dynamics on a micro scale.
- I realise that the soay sheep is perhaps the best example of feedbacks, as it is complete.},

abstract = {1) Micro-evolutionary predictions are complicated by ecological feedbacks like density dependence, while ecological predictions can be complicated by evolutionary change. A widely used approach in micro-evolution, quantitative genetics, struggles to incorporate ecological processes into predictive models, while structured population modelling, a tool widely used in ecology, rarely incorporates evolution explicitly. 2) In this paper we develop a flexible, general framework that links quantitative genetics and structured population models. We use the quantitative genetic approach to write down the phenotype as an additive map. We then construct integral projection models for each component of the phenotype. The dynamics of the distribution of the phenotype are generated by combining distributions of each of its components. Population projection models can be formulated on per generation or on shorter time steps. 3) We introduce the framework before developing example models with parameters chosen to exhibit specific dynamics. These models reveal (i) how evolution of a phenotype can cause populations to move from one dynamical regime to another (e.g. from stationarity to cycles), (ii) how additive genetic variances and covariances (the G matrix) are expected to evolve over multiple generations, (iii) how changing heritability with age can maintain additive genetic variation in the face of selection and (iii) life history, population dynamics, phenotypic characters and parameters in ecological models will change as adaptation occurs. 4) Our approach unifies population ecology and evolutionary biology providing a framework allowing a very wide range of questions to be addressed. The next step is to apply the approach to a variety of laboratory and field systems. Once this is done we will have a much deeper understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks.},

abstract = {Uncovering the genetic and evolutionary basis of local adaptation is a major focus of evolutionary biology. The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation. With attention to their current limitations, genome scan methods can be an important tool in finding the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.},

abstract = {This paper describes the coevolution ofphenotypes in a community comprising a population ofpredators and ofprey. It is shown that evolutionary cycling is a likely outcome ofthe process. The dynamical systems on which this description is based are constructed from microscopic stochastic birth and death events, together with a process ofrandom mutation. Births and deaths are caused in part by phenotype-dependent interactions between predator and prey individuals and therefore generate natural selection. Three outcomes of evolution are demonstrated. A community may evolve to a state at which the predator becomes extinct, or to one at which the species coexist with constant phenotypic values, or the species may coexist with cyclic changes in phenotypic values. The last outcome corresponds to a Red Queen dynamic, in which the selection pressures arising from the predator–prey interaction cause the species to evolve without ever reaching an equilibrium phenotypic state. The Red Queen dynamic requires an intermediate harvesting efficiency of the prey by the predator and sufficiently high evolutionary rate constant of the prey, and is robust when the model is made stochastic and phenotypically polymorphic. A cyclic outcome lies outside the contemporary focus on evolutionary equilibria, and argues for an extension to a dynamical framework for describing the asymptotic states of evolution.},

When species interactions are weak or inconsistent, evolutionary dynamics should be predictable by factors iden-tified by single-species theory. Stronger species interactions, however, can alter evolutionary outcomes and either dampen or promote evolution of con-stituent species depending on the number of species and the distribution of interaction strengths across the interaction network. Genetic interactions, such as horizontal gene transfer, might also affect evolutionary outcomes. These evolutionary mechanisms in turn affect whole-community properties, such as the level of ecosystem functioning.

abstract = {The ecological effects of predator removal and its consequence on prey behavior have been investigated widely; however, predator removal can also cause contemporary evolution of prey resulting in prey genetic change. Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of prey traits such as movement, reproduction and foraging. We use EcoSim simulation which allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioral models, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We model organisms' behavior using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) that are coded in their genomes which has a clear semantics making reasoning about causality of any evolved behavior possible. We show that the contemporary evolution of prey behavior owing to predator removal is also accompanied by prey genetic change. We employed machine learning methods, now recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of our understanding and prediction of ecological phenomena. A classification algorithm was used to demonstrate the difference between genomes belonging to prey coevolving with predators and prey evolving in the absence of predation pressure. We argue that predator introductions to naive prey might be destabilizing if prey have evolved and adapted to the absence of predators. Our results suggest that both predator introductions and predator removal from an ecosystem have widespread effects on the survival and evolution of prey by altering their genomes and behavior, even after relatively short time intervals. Our study highlights the need to consider both ecological and evolutionary time scales, as well as the complex interplay of behaviors between trophic levels, in determining the outcomes of predator-prey interactions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Since normal neural networks are data-intensive and cannot provide predictive uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian approach to convolutional neural nets. A recently introduced variational gradient descent algorithm based on Stein's method is scaled to deep convolutional networks to perform approximate Bayesian inference on millions of uncertain network parameters. This approach achieves state of the art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification in comparison to other approaches in Bayesian neural networks as well as techniques that include Gaussian processes and ensemble methods even when the training data size is relatively small. To evaluate the performance of this approach, we consider standard uncertainty quantification tasks for flow in heterogeneous media using limited training data consisting of permeability realizations and the corresponding velocity and pressure fields. The performance of the surrogate model developed is very good even though there is no underlying structure shared between the input (permeability) and output (flow/pressure) fields as is often the case in the image-to-image regression models used in computer vision problems. Studies are performed with an underlying stochastic input dimensionality up to 4225 where most other uncertainty quantification methods fail.

Using data from five elk (Cervus canadensis) reintroduced to central Ontario, we employed artificial neural networks to estimate movement probability kernels as functions of three landscape-behavioral processes. These consisted of measures of the animals' response to the physical spatial structure of the landscape, the spatial variability in resources, and memory of previously visited locations. The results support the view that animal movement results from interactions among elements of landscape structure and behavior, motivating context-dependent movement probabilities, rather than from successive realizations of static distributions, as some traditional models of movement and resource selection assume.

Over the past three decades, characterizing the genes underlying adaptive phenotypic change has revealed many important aspects of evolutionary change. At the same time, natural selection is often fundamentally an ecological process that can often be studied without identifying the genes underlying the variation on which it acts. This duality has given rise to disagreement about whether, and under what circumstances, it is necessary to identify specific genes associated with phenotypic change. This issue is of practical concern, especially for researchers who study non-model organisms, because of the often enormous cost and labor required to “go for the genes”. We here consider a number of situations and questions commonly addressed by researchers. Our conclusion is that while gene identification can be crucial for answering some questions, there are others for which definitive answers can be obtained without finding underlying genes. It should thus not be assumed that considerations of “empirical completeness” dictate that gene identification is always desirable. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

abstract = {The Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare pelt data by the Hudson's Bay Company do not fit the classical predator-prey theory. Rather than following the peak density of the hares, the peak density of the lynx leads it, creating the hares-eat-lynx (HEL) paradox. Although trappers were suspected to be a cause, no mathematical models in the literature have demon-strated the HEL effect. In this paper we consider various multitrophic models with interactions in vegetation-hare-lynx, hare-lynx-coyote, hare-lynx-trapper, and hare-lynx-coyote-trapper, and use Newton's gradient search method to best fit each model to the data and then select the one with the least error as the benchmark model for the data. We will conclude from the bench-mark model and its sensitivity analysis the following: (a) the trappers as a participant rather than an observer of the system changed the observed; (b) the lynx and hare populations in the wild follow the lynx-eats-hares (LEH) cycle but the harvested animals follow the HEL cycle; (c) the benchmark fit is more sensitive to changes in all lynx-trapper interactions than the respective hare-trapper interactions; (d) trappers did not interfere each other's trapping activities a cen-tury ago; (e) the Hudson's Bay Company's hare pelt number was severely fewer than it should be. These results together dispel a long-held hypothesis that the pelt data is a proxy of the hare and lynx populations in the wild. It also shows that theoretical ecology must move beyond the classical Lotka-Volterra paradigm into a contemporary framework in which Holling's predation theory is central to population modeling. It also demonstrates to the ecologists that we do not have to collect data from all dimensions in order to gain a good understanding of complex systems, but instead we can systematically fit models to empirical data of any dimensions with identifiable uncertainties and a complete understanding of parameter sensitivities to the best fit.

Theoretical work to mechanistically understand how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability has focused on specific ecological modules with just one or two evolving species. Here, we provide a general framework for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how these feedbacks lead to stable communities that would be unstable in the absence of the feedbacks, and vice versa. In addition, we show how this characterization provides a partitioning of the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on community stability, and how this partitioning depends on the rate of evolution relative to ecology. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade-offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize community dynamics.},
annote = {1. Introduction
- Theoretical work on eco-evo feedbacks mostly focused on simple models (2-3 species etc.) => neglects complexity of natural ecosystems.
- Need for general framework to understand the mechanism linking eco-evo feedbacks to ecosystem dynamics.

2. Methods
- Partition ecosystem dynamics in eco and evo only dynamics, and eco-evo and evo-eco dynamics.
- Dynamical system with ecological state variables (population density) and evolutionary state variables (traits).
- Stability analysis via sensitivity analysis, eigen vectors of jacobians and so on.
- Study two limits: when evolution is slow (ecology fast moving), and evolution is fast (ecology constant).
- Take two examples (one being a tri-trophic network).

3. Results
- For instance, they show that unstable direct evolution can be stabilized by feedbakcs in slow evolution.
- Feebacks can stabilized unstable ecological dynamics in fast evolutionary response.
- Trait correlations can change the quality of the eco-evo equilibrium in the slow evolution case.

4. Discussion
- Theory does not apply for intermediate evolutionary speed (when evolution occurs at the same rate as ecology).
- They provide general conditions on relative rate of evolution for stability of ecosystem eco-evo dynamics.
- Framework can be extended to encompass different genetic architecture (e.g. yamamichi).
- Future directions: (i) general framework for when eco and evo on same time scale ; (ii) investigate the effect of complexity on stability, as it may prevent us from acquiring analytical results ; (iii) apply framework to empirical systems to infer elements of the jacobian, and hence discuss the relative contribution of eco and evo to overall dynamics.

5. Comments
- No genetic architecture.
- Ecological structure not accounted for.
- Equation for the trait not mechanistic.
- No population structure.
- Still may be a nice basis for quick and dirty exploration such as stochastic reduction.
- No intermediate time scale...},

abstract = {Global change is heating up ecosystems fuelling biodiversity loss and species extinctions. High-trophic-level predators are especially prone to extinction due to an energetic mismatch between increasing feeding rates and metabolism with warming. Different adaptation mechanisms such as decreasing body size to reduce energy requirements (morphological response) as well as direct effects of adaptation to feeding parameters (physiological response) have been proposed to overcome this problem. Here, we use protist-bacteria microcosm experiments to show how those adaptations may have the potential to buffer the impact of warming on predator-prey interactions. After adapting the ciliate predator Tetrahymena pyriformis to three different temperatures (15C, 20C and 25C) for approximately 20 generations we conducted functional response experiments on bacterial prey along an experimental temperature gradient (15C, 20C and 25C). We found an increase of maximum feeding rates and half-saturation densities with rising experimental temperatures. Adaptation temperature had on average slightly negative effects on maximum feeding rates, but maximum feeding rates increased more strongly with rising experimental temperature in warm adapted predators than in cold-adapted predators. There was no effect of adaptation temperature on half-saturation densities characterising foraging efficiency. Besides the mixed response in functional response parameters, predators also adapted by decreasing body size. As smaller predators need less energy to fulfill their energetic demands, maximum feeding rates relative to the energetic demands increased slightly with increased adaptation temperature. Accordingly, predators adapted to 25C showed the highest feeding rates at 25C experimental temperature, while predators adapted to 15C showed the highest maximum feeding rate at 15C. Therefore, adaptation to different temperatures potentially avoids an energetic mismatch with warming. Especially a shift in body size with warming additionally to an adaptation of physiological parameters potentially helps to maintain a positive energy balance and prevent predator extinction with rising temperatures.},

abstract = {The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.},

abstract = {Population dynamics and evolutionary change are linked by the fundamental biological processes of birth and death. This means that population growth may correlate with the strength of selection, whereas evolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We decompose population growth in an age-structured population into contributions from variation in a quantitative trait. We report that the distribution of body sizes within a population of Soay sheep can markedly influence population dynamics, accounting for up to one-fifth of observed population growth. Our results suggest that there is substantial opportunity for evolutionary dynamics to leave an ecological signature and visa versa. E},
annote = {Takeaway:
- The authors link trait variation to population growth, thus demonstrating the possibility for demography and evolution to interplay.
- I see that they do not demonstrate directly that demography affects phenotypic change in return, though they demonstrate that this is highly likely judging by their analysis of the strength of selection.

Notes:
- The authors explore the relationship between phenotypic variation and population growth. To do this they compute individual contributions to the next population through survival and breeding. They observe how indiviudal contributions change with phenotype value with gams. 
- Then they looked how individual contributions varied throughout years and found variation consistent with environmental changes (NAO). Low survival years were associated with greater contributions of individuals to population growth. This raises the possibility for harsher environments to associate with greater evolutionnary change, which rejoins results from the D-Finch.
- The authors thereby report evidence for changes in the shape of selection, i.e. temporally varying selection.
- The authors use contributions as the strength of selection. I understand that this does not directly quantify selection itself, (i.e. the response), and hence trait variation.

From Duplicate 2 (The Evolutionary Demography of Ecological Change: Linking Trait Variation and Population Growth - Pelletier, Fanie; Clutton-Brock, Tim; Pemberton, Josephine; Tuljapurkar, Shripad; Coulson, Tim)

NOTES

- quantiative traits (e.g. weight) influences population growth rate and thereby ecological dynamics, in turn selection strength varied with ecological dynamics.

- increase in NAO increases Weight contribution to pop growth => Contribution of traits to population growth depends on the environment ( harsher environments may potentially associate with "greater" evolution).

- lim: mechanism quiet unclear, only traits influences interaction with environment and hence fitness => influence pop growth.

SUMMARY
M&M: soay sheep ; calculate relation btwn traits and pop growth (gams)
Results: trait contribution to pop growth can be high, but flucuates with time
Discussion: Environment influences contribution of traits to pop growth => interplay between selection (evol stage of the pop) and the ecol stage of the environment},

abstract = {In times of rapid global change, anticipating vegetation changes and assessing their impacts is of key relevance to managers and policy makers. Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision-making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics (SVD), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (103–106) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network (DNN) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the SVD approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta-modelling context. We trained a DNN using simulations of a process-based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of SVD to project long-term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. SVD captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions. In addition, we tested the computational efficiency of the approach, highlighting the utility of SVD for country- to continental scale applications. SVD is the—to our knowledge—first vegetation model harnessing deep neural networks. The approach has high predictive accuracy and is able to generalize well beyond training data. SVD was designed to run on widely available input data (e.g. vegetation states defined from remote sensing, gridded global climate datasets) and exceeds the computational performance of currently available highly optimized landscape models by three to four orders of magnitude. We conclude that SVD is a promising approach for combining detailed process knowledge on fine-grained ecosystem processes with the increasingly available big ecological datasets for improved large-scale projections of vegetation dynamics.},

Here we present FITS (Flexible Inference from Time-Series) - a computational framework that allows inference of either the fitness of a mutation, the mutation rate or the population size from genomic time-series sequencing data. FITS was designed first and foremost for analysis of either short-term Evolve & Resequence (E&R) experiments, or for rapidly recombining populations of viruses. We thoroughly explore the performance of FITS on noisy simulated data, and highlight its ability to infer meaningful information even in those circumstances.

We next apply FITS to empirical data from an E&R experiment on poliovirus where parameters were determined experimentally and demonstrate extremely high accuracy in inference. We highlight the ease of use of FITS for step-wise or iterative inference of mutation rates, population size, and fitness values for each mutation sequenced, when deep sequencing data is available at multiple time-points.

Concurrent long-term studies on the dynamics of the same two interacting species in different locations are very rare. This result has led to the tacit assumption that diffehjkrent cases of the same two-species interaction would involve essentially quantitative differences (e.g., context-specific differences in the numeric values of demographic parameters like fecundity or death rates). Here, we show that for one of the best-known two-species systems (ragwort and cinnabar moth), this finding does not hold. The interaction between the plant and its herbivore is fundamentally different in coastal dunes in The Netherlands and in grasslands in Southeast England. In the first case, the dynamics are cyclic and the interaction involves both direct and delayed density dependence; in the second case, the insect has little impact on plant dynamics and there are no time lags in density dependence. The difference is caused by differences in the importance of seed-limitation in plant recruitment in the two locations.},

On the other hand, models based on the Price equation track the dynamics of a trait average, coupled with a description of ecological dynamics. The aim of this article is to show that, in class-structured populations, both approaches yield the same expression for the selection gradient under weak selection. Although the result is not new, I propose an alternative route to its derivation using the dynamics of scaled measures of between-class phenotypic differentiation. Under weak selection, these measures of phenotypic differentiation can be treated as fast variables compared to the trait mean, which allows for a quasi-equilibrium approximation. This suggests a different approach to calculating weak selection approximations of evolutionary dynamics, and clarifies the links between short- and long-term perspectives on evolution in structured populations.},

abstract = {Evolutionary biology and ecology have a strong theoretical underpinning, and this has fostered a variety of modeling approaches. A major challenge of this theoretical work has been to unravel the tangled feedback loop between ecology and evolution. This has prompted the development of two main classes of models. While quantitative genetics models jointly consider the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of a focal population, a separation of timescales between ecology and evolution is assumed by evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and inclusive fitness theory. As a result, theoretical evolutionary ecology tends to be divided among different schools of thought, with different toolboxes and motivations. My aim in this synthesis is to highlight the connections between these different approaches and clarify the current state of theory in evolutionary ecology. Central to this approach is to make explicit the dependence on environmental dynamics of the population and evolutionary dynamics, thereby materializing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. This perspective sheds light on the interplay between environmental feedback and the timescales of ecological and evolutionary processes. I conclude by discussing some potential extensions and challenges to our current theoretical understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

- One of the challenges as well is to link it with a suitable genetic architecture for the traits.

abstract = {Trophic relationships, such as those between predator and prey or between pathogen and host, are key interactions linking species in ecological food webs. The structure of these links and their strengths have major consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations, in rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats, show that the predator or pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly linked in these experimental microcosms, but without this knowledge, we would infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring defense against attack, and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the phage-bacteria experiments, where bacterial evolution could be tracked. Modeling suggests that rapid evolution may also confound experimental approaches to measuring interaction strength, but it identifies certain experimental designs as being more robust against potential confounding by rapid evolution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Yoshida et al.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the Ecological Society of America Understanding intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of reproductive success is central to advancing animal ecology and characterizing critical habitat. Unfortunately, much of the work examining drivers of reproductive success is biased toward particular groups of organisms (e.g., colonial birds, large herbivores, capital breeders). Long-lived mammalian carnivores that are of conservation concern, solitary, and territorial present an excellent situation to examine intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of reproductive success, yet they have received little attention. Here, we used a Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) data set, from the southern periphery of their range, to determine if reproductive success in a solitary carnivore was consistent with capital or income breeding. We radio-marked and monitored 36 female Canada lynx for 98 lynx years. We evaluated how maternal characteristics and indices of food supply (via forest structure) in core areas influenced variation in body condition and reproductive success. We characterized body condition as mass/length and reproductive success as whether a female produced a litter of kittens for a given breeding season. Consistent with life-history theory, we documented a positive effect of maternal age on body condition and reproductive success. In contrast to predictions of capital breeding, we observed no effect of pre-pregnancy body condition on reproductive success in Canada lynx. However, we demonstrated statistical effects of forest structure on reproductive success in Canada lynx, consistent with predictions of income breeding. The forest characteristics that defined high success included (1) abundant and connected mature forest and (2) intermediate amounts of small-diameter regenerating forest. These attributes are consistent with providing abundant, temporally stable, and accessible prey resources (i.e., snowshoe hares; Lepus americanus) for lynx and reinforce the bottom-up mechanisms influencing Canada lynx populations. Collectively, our results suggest that lynx on the southern range periphery exhibit an income breeding strategy and that forest structure supplies the income important for successful reproduction. More broadly, our insights advance the understanding of carnivore ecology and serve as an important example on integrating long-term field studies with ecological theory to improve landscape management.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetics of adaptation is a central focus in evolutionary biology. Here, we use a population genomics approach to examine striking parallel morphological divergences of parapatric stream-lake ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish in three watersheds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada. Genome-wide variation at greater than 1000 single nucleotide polymorphism loci indicate separate origin of giant lake and small-bodied stream fish within each watershed (mean F(ST) between watersheds = 0.244 and within = 0.114). Genome scans within watersheds identified a total of 21 genomic regions that are highly differentiated between ecotypes and are probably subject to directional selection. Most outliers were watershed-specific, but genomic regions undergoing parallel genetic changes in multiple watersheds were also identified. Interestingly, several of the stream-lake outlier regions match those previously identified in marine-freshwater and benthic-limnetic genome scans, indicating reuse of the same genetic loci in different adaptive scenarios. We also identified multiple new outlier loci, which may contribute to unique aspects of differentiation in stream-lake environments. Overall, our data emphasize the important role of ecological boundaries in driving both local and broadly occurring parallel genetic changes during adaptation.},

abstract = {Our knowledge about population-level effects of abiotic stressors is limited, largely due to lack of appropriate time-series data. To analyse interactions between an abiotic stressor and density-dependent processes, we used experimental time-series data for stage-structured populations (the blowfly Lucilia sericata) exposed to the toxicant cadmium through 20 generations. Resource limitation results in competition both in the larval and the adult stages. The toxicant has only negative effects at the organism level, but nevertheless, there were positive population-level effects. These are necessarily indirect, and indicate overcompensatory density-dependent responses. A non-parametric model (generalized additive model) was used to investigate the density-dependent structures of the demographic rates, without making assumptions about the functional forms. The estimated structures were used to develop a parametric model, with which we analysed effects of the toxicant on density-dependent and density-independent components of the stage-specific demographic rates. The parameter estimates identified both synergistic and antagonistic density-toxicant interactions. It is noteworthy that the synergistic interaction occurred together with a net positive effect of the toxicant. Hence, the effects of such interactions should be considered together with the capacity for compensatory responses. The combination of the two modelling approaches provided new insight into mechanisms for compensatory responses to abiotic stressors. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {1. Species that coexist in diverse natural communities inter- act in complex ways that alter each other's abundances and affect se- lection on each other's traits. Consequently, predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016, the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context, focusing on microevolutionary pro- cesses. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. 3. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions. Genetic correlations of ecological traits in one species can alter trait evolution and adaptation as well as the abundances of other species. In general, evolution in multispecies communities can change ecological interactions, which then feed back to future evolutionary changes in ways that depend on these indirect effects. 4. We suggest avenues for future research in this field, including determining the circumstances under which pair- wise evolution does not adequately describe evolutionary trajectories.},

The majority (74%) of the 125 networks into which the meadows were clustered are below the extinction threshold for long-term persistence. Among the 33 networks above the threshold, spatial configuration and habitat quality rather than the pooled habitat area predict metapopulation size and persistence, but additionally allelic variation in a SNP in the gene Phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) explains 30% of variation in metapopulation size. The Pgi genotypes are associated with dispersal rate and hence with colonizations and extinctions.

abstract = {Predicted universal responses of ectotherms to climate warming include increased maximum population growth rate and changes in body size through the temperature-size rule. However, the mechanisms that would underlie these predicted responses are not clear. Many studies have focused on proximate mechanisms of physiological processes affecting individual growth. One can also consider ultimate mechanisms involving adaptive explanations by evaluating temperature effects on different vital rates across the life history and using the information in a population dynamical model. Here, we combine long-term data for a top predator in freshwater ecosystems (pike; Esox lucius) with a stochastic integral projection model to analyze concurrent effects of temperature on vital rates, body size, and population dynamics. As predicted, the net effect of warming on population growth rate (fitness) is positive, but the thermal sensitivity of this rate is highly size- and vital rate-dependent. These results are not sensitive to increasing variability in temperature. Somatic growth follows the temperature-size rule, and our results support an adaptive explanation for this response. The stable length structure of the population shifts with warming toward an increased proportion of medium-sized but a reduced proportion of small and large individuals. This study highlights how demographic approaches can help reveal complex underlying mechanisms for population responses to warming.},

abstract = {What determines whether fleeing prey escape from attacking predators To answer this question, biologists have developed mathematical models that incorporate attack geometries, pursuit and escape trajectories, and kinematics of predator and prey. These models have rarely been tested using data from actual predator-prey encounters. To address this problem, we recorded multi-camera infrared videography of bat-insect interactions in a large outdoor enclosure.We documented 235 attacks by four Myotis volans bats on a variety of moths. Bat and moth flight trajectories from 50 high-quality attacks were reconstructed in 3-D. Despite having higher maximum velocity, deceleration and overall turning ability, bats only captured evasive prey in 69 of 184 attacks (37.5%); bats captured nearly all moths not evading attack (50 of 51; 98%). Logistic regression indicated that prey radial acceleration and escape angle were the most important predictors of escape success (44 of 50 attacks correctly classified; 88%). We found partial support for the turning gambit mathematical model; however, it underestimated the escape threshold by 25% of prey velocity and did not account for prey escape angle. Whereas most prey escaping strikes flee away from predators, moths typically escaped chasing bats by turning with high radial acceleration toward 'safety zones' that flank the predator. This strategy may be widespread in prey engaged in chases. Based on these findings, we developed a novel geometrical model of predation. We discuss implications of this model for the co-evolution of predator and prey kinematics and pursuit and escape strategies.},

abstract = {Evolution can be predicted in the short term from a knowledge of selection and inheritance. However, in the long term evolution is unpredictable because environments, which determine the directions and magnitudes of selection coefficients, fluctuate unpredictably. These two features of evolution, the predictable and unpredictable, are demonstrated in a study of two populations of Darwin's finches on the Gal{\'{a}}pagos island of Daphne Major. From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change.},

- The authors show that there is evidence for natural selection followed by evolution of beak size and width in both fortis and scandens.
- Changes in beak size is not consistent with selection in some years possibly in line with introgression.

Notes
- Author says that adults are borned a year before. I see that this population goes rapidly through life stages, and does not support potentially medium term lag effects of direct phenotypic change. I suspect that any impacts of different variables on the demography are observable the following year.
- Author show that hybridisation remains low (<20%) in the population. I see that introgression is not at play during the time that you consider.
- I see that selection on beak size can occur continuously in time, by affecting survival (i.e. removing individuals with larger beak sizes) at any point in time. It can also affect breeding which itself takes place over several months in each year, allowing for selection to be spaced out in time. This makes the continuous approach relevant.

Evolution by non-adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology–evolution (eco–evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes – genetic and demographic.

A difficult challenge, however, is establishing the link between the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history and the consequences for population dynamics. The smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai, is a good example. Larval instars differ dramatically in size and have a tendency for cannibalism, which suggests the potential for strong asymmetric interactions among instars. Yet whether these asymmetries have any role in generating the distinct single-generation cycles observed in the field and laboratory is unclear. Here we report on the development of a new experimental approach to characterize the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history that can be directly embedded into stage-structured population models. The experiments use donor-replacement protocols in which focal individuals are challenged to complete their life cycles in competitive environments where the instar and density of the competitors are held constant. The experimentally derived interaction surface contains all the information about stage-specific interactions and provides a straightforward framework for evaluating alternative ways of abstracting the interactions into traditional models of asymmetric competition. Working with the smaller tea tortrix, we found strong evidence of asymmetric interactions and identified critical “tipping points” in the competitive environment that strongly affected survival but not development. We incorporated the experimentally derived interaction surface into a stage-structured population model and found that despite the strong impact that asymmetric interactions have on tea tortrix life history, they do not scale-up to impact the predicted asymptotic population dynamics. Comparing these dynamics with two abstracted models of stage-structured interactions revealed that while the quantitative details of the emergent dynamics depends on the shape of the interaction surface, the qualitative features, such as the emergence of single-generation cycles and rapid synchronization of development among individuals, are pleasingly robust.},

Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity.

annote = {Takeaways:
- state that feedbacks are the next challenge, and that they are hard to identify because their complexity of the need for long term studies.

Notes:
- the authors group eco-evolutionary field into three sub-fields: (i) study of effects between phenotypes and demography; (ii) study of interplay between environment and genetic structure of populations; and (iii) importance of microevolutionary processes for community composition and ecosystem processes. I personnally think this classificaiton is somewhat anecdotal and that the papers I have read do not fall clearly into these three distinct modes.
- On the history of the field: the author point at the fact that Darwin and fisher already recognised the interplay between ecology and evolution. Benefited largely from the rising availability in long term time series, and enhanced capacity to detect selection and genetic basis for traits.
- Bi-directional effects of ecology to evolution and back again are feedbacks. At the time the authors wrote their piece, feedbacks seemed to not be inferred yet. Even today when reading Hendry et al. 2017 it seems that it is still not the case...
- The authors state that by definition natural selection should leave a trace on population dynmaics as that operates through deaths and births. What I find confusing is that though natural selection has been evidenced to be at play in the finch system there is no clear signature on the demography of the finches.
- A useful quote here: pelletier et al. 2009 propose a counterquote to Dobzhansky's 'nothing in ecology makes sense except in the light of evolution', twhich goes as follows: 'nothing in evolution makes sense except in the light of ecology'. Which creates a nice chicken and egg problem.
- The author state that feedbacks are not well documented and understood yet because there is a shortage of studies quantifying the evo to eco effects (except in finch, soay sheep, etc.).
- The authors discuss at length how ecology might impact the genetic structure of population, and hence lay the basis for eco-to-evo effects. This reminds me of the importance of considering alternative genetic structures. I overall realise that exploring feedbacks really is about exploring complexity at the phenotypic, demographic, environmental level, opening each box is costly.
- The authors state that long term studies are the way to go to disentangle the complexity of the potential feedbacks. I see this rejoin the statements made in Fussman et al. 2006 regarding the complexity of the systems at play and the need for long term/live monitoring of dynamical systems and anaylsis through mathematical modelling.
- They also point at the fact that feedbacks are possibly only measurable during transient states, where the system is changing. That rejoins the statement of another study... which I need to find the reference of.},

To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black–Scholes equation, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, and the Allen–Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.},

abstract = {Abstract Statistical techniques exist for inferring community assembly processes from community patterns. Habitat filtering, competition, and biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference techniques is, however, debated as a mechanistic and causal link between process and pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes and trophic interactions are ignored. Here, we revisit the current knowledge on community assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews that have outlined challenges associated with current inference techniques, we identify a discrepancy between the current paradigm of eco-evolutionary community assembly and current inference techniques that focus mainly on competition and habitat filtering. We argue that trait-based dynamic eco-evolutionary models in combination with recently developed model fitting and model evaluation techniques can provide avenues for more accurate, reliable, and inclusive inference. To exemplify, we implement a trait-based, spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification, fitting, and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from diverse data sources. Through a case study on inference of prey and predator niche width in an eco-evolutionary context, we demonstrate how inclusive and mechanistic approaches?eco-evolutionary modelling and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)?can enable inference of assembly processes that have been largely neglected by traditional techniques despite the ubiquity of such processes. Much literature points to the limitations of current inference techniques, but concrete solutions to such limitations are few. Many of the challenges associated with novel inference techniques are, however, already to some extent resolved in other fields and thus ready to be put into action in a more formal way for inferring processes of community assembly from signals in various data sources.},
annote = {Summary
- they build an eco-evo patch-based and trait-based ODE model were dispersion on the phenotypic space is modelled by a mutation kernel.
- They simulate the model from priors over a given time period and compare model outcome to observations. Through an rejection scheme they retain only the best solutions, which gives parameter estimations.

Notes
- the authors state that there is a need for inferring processes from observations, given that not every processes can be accounted for in experiments due to the complexity of natural systems.
- I see that this paper calls for inference technique that rely on a more mechanistic modelling of the dynamics of ecosystem comunities.
- The author states that identifying processes in communities is complicated because there are multiple processes that can produce the same patterns, and often these processes do interplay.
- Authors state that community dynmaics rarely consider both spatial and temporal dynamics, trophic interactions, and evolution.
- they state the approach should be accompanied by model selection => I see that as a potential limit to the framework given the complexity of the processes considered.
- Though their data was simulated on 5000 evolutionary steps, they do not mention how long was the predictive model simulated for. It is hence unclear how that would be overcome in practice.
- I think the statistical scheme is interesting in the context of your NODE paper. You could invoke the ABC rejection principle to justify the recovery of approximate posterior distribution of the parameters. However, you would still need the optimisation step otherwise the fit would be crap.
- On this last note, I think this approach is only suitable for very well specified models in well known systems. Indeed they only simulate from priors, if they infer only two parameters there is a good chance they would sample accidentally a good scenario, this become virtually impossible for higher dimensional models. Hence, you would need at least an optimisation step. But I guess this would work for "simple" model, or for really not greedy "inferences" (i.e. getting at only a few parameters).
- There is alot of shadows surrounding the choice of initial conditions, time period on which to run the model, as this is likely to affect the model output as much if not more than parameter specifications. For instance for the same parameters, if you simulate the model for a short amount of time you would obtain an output close to initial conditions, if you simulate the model for a really long time you will get something different.
- What about model stochasticity? I guess this is accounted for in the ABC rejection scheme.},

The nonlinearity, in contrast, appears to arise from phase dependencies in hunting success by lynx through the cycle.

abstract = {Adaptive divergence between adjoining populations reflects a balance between the diversifying effect of divergent selection and the potentially homogenizing effect of gene flow. In most models of migration-selection balance, gene flow is assumed to reflect individuals' inherent capacity to disperse, without regard to the match between individuals' phenotypes and the available habitats. However, habitat preferences can reduce dispersal between contrasting habitats, thereby alleviating migration load and facilitating adaptive divergence. We tested whether habitat preferences contribute to adaptive divergence in a classic example of migration-selection balance: parapatric lake and stream populations of three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using a mark-transplant-recapture experiment on morphologically divergent parapatric populations, we showed that 90% of lake and stream stickleback returned to their native habitat, reducing migration between habitats by 76%. Furthermore, we found that dispersal into a nonnative habitat was phenotype dependent. Stream fish moving into the lake were morphologically more lake-like than those returning to the stream (and the converse for lake fish entering the stream). The strong native habitat preference documented here increases the extent of adaptive divergence between populations two- to fivefold relative to expectations with random movement. These results illustrate the potential importance of adaptive habitat choice in driving parapatric divergence.},

abstract = {Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population dynamics. Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate substantially, declines in aphid population growth rates do not coincide with increases in parasitism. Therefore, parasitism cannot be responsible for the density-dependent regulation of aphid populations observed in the field. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

- The authors seem to estimate time varying vital rates in a structured population dynamics model for aphid.

- The paper shows that vital rates and parasitism are sensitive to density, and therefore not consistent in time. This can be a source of context-dependence.
- The conclusion of the paper is still unclear to me and confusing.

abstract = {Social behavior involves "staying and helping," two individual attributes that vary considerably among organisms. Investigating the ultimate causes of such variation, this study integrates previously separate lines of research by analyzing the joint evolution of altruism and mobility. We unfold the network of selective pressures and derive how these depend on physiological costs, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and a complex interaction between the evolving traits. Our analysis highlights habitat saturation, both around individuals (local aggregation) and around unoccupied space (local contention), as the key mediator of altruism and mobility evolution. Once altruism and mobility are allowed to evolve jointly, three general insights emerge. First, the cost of mobility affects the origin of altruism, determining whether and how quickly selfishness is overcome. Second, the cost of altruism determines which of two qualitatively different routes to sociality are taken: an evolutionary reduction of mobility, resulting in higher habitat saturation, is either preceded or followed by the adaptive rise of altruism. Third, contrary to conventional expectations, a positive correlation between evolutionarily stable levels of altruism and mobility can arise; this is expected when comparing populations that evolved under different constraints on mobility or that differ in other life-history traits.},

abstract = {Fossil sequences provide observations of phenotypes within a lineage over time and represent essential data for increasing our understanding of phyletic evolution beyond microevolutionary timescales. I investigate if fossil times‐series of the diatom Stephanodiscus niagarae/yellowstonensis follow evolutionary dynamics compatible with hypotheses for how the adaptive landscape changes when a population enters a new environment. The lineage – which has a remarkably detailed stratigraphic record – invaded Yellowstone Lake immediately after recession of ice from the basin 14,000 years ago. Several phyletic models portraying different types of evolutionary dynamics – both compatible and not compatible with changes in the adaptive landscape following ecological opportunity – were fitted to the fossil times‐series of S. niagarae/yellowstonensis. Different models best describe the three analyzed traits. Two of the models (a new model of decelerated evolution and an {Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck} model) capture trait dynamics compatible with an event of ecological opportunity, while the third model (random walk) does not. Entering a new environment may accordingly affect trait dynamics for thousands of years, but the effects can vary across phenotypes. However, tests of model adequacy reveal shortcomings in all three models explaining the trait dynamics, suggesting model development is needed to more fully understand the phyletic evolution in Stephanodiscus niagarae/yellowstonensis.

abstract = {Large networks of weather radars are comprehensive instruments for studying bird migration. For example, the US WSR-88D network covers the entire continental US and has archived data since the 1990s. The data can quantify both broad and fine-scale bird movements to address a range of migration ecology questions. However, the problem of automatically discriminating precipitation from biology has significantly limited the ability to conduct biological analyses with historical radar data. We develop MistNet, a deep convolutional neural network to discriminate precipitation from biology in radar scans. Unlike prior machine learning approaches, MistNet makes fine-scaled predictions and can collect biological information from radar scans that also contain precipitation. MistNet is based on neural networks for images, and includes several architecture components tailored to the unique characteristics of radar data. To avoid a massive human labelling effort, we train MistNet using abundant noisy labels obtained from dual polarization radar data. In historical and contemporary WSR-88D data, MistNet identifies at least 95.9% of all biomass with a false discovery rate of 1.3%. Dual polarization training data and our radar-specific architecture components are effective. By retaining biomass that co-occurs with precipitation in a single radar scan, MistNet retains 15% more biomass than traditional whole-scan approaches to screening. MistNet is fully automated and can be applied to datasets of millions of radar scans to produce fine-grained predictions that enable a range of applications, from continent-scale mapping to local analysis of airspace usage. Radar ornithology is advancing rapidly and leading to significant discoveries about continent-scale patterns of bird movements. General-purpose and empirically validated methods to quantify biological signals in radar data are essential to the future development of this field. MistNet can enable large-scale, long-term, and reproducible measurements of whole migration systems.},

abstract = {Natural systems harbor complex interactions that are fundamental parts of ecology and evolution. These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.},

Although the impact of ecological change on evolutionary response has long been acknowledged, the converse has predominantly been neglected, especially empirically. By applying a recently published conceptual framework, we assess and contrast the relative importance of phenotypic and environmental variability on annual population growth in five ungulate populations. In four of the five populations, the contribution of phenotypic variability was greater than the contribution of environmental variability, although not significantly so. The similarity in the contributions of environment and phenotype suggests that neither is worthy of neglect.

abstract = {Balancing selection describes any form of natural selection, which results in the persis- tence of multiple variants of a trait at intermediate frequencies within populations. By offering up a snapshot of multiple co-occurring functional variants and their interac- tions, systems under balancing selection can reveal the evolutionary mechanisms favouring the emergence and persistence of adaptive variation in natural populations. We here focus on the mechanisms by which several functional variants for a given trait can arise, a process typically requiring multiple epistatic mutations. We highlight how balancing selection can favour specific features in the genetic architecture and review the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms shaping this architecture. First, balancing selection affects the number of loci underlying differentiated traits and their respective effects. Control by one or few loci favours the persistence of differentiated functional variants by limiting intergenic recombination, or its impact, and may some- times lead to the evolution of supergenes. Chromosomal rearrangements, particularly inversions, preventing adaptive combinations from being dissociated are increasingly being noted as features of such systems. Similarly, due to the frequency of heterozy- gotes maintained by balancing selection, dominance may be a key property of adaptive variants. High heterozygosity and limited recombination also influence associated genetic load, as linked recessive deleterious mutations may be sheltered. The capture of deleterious elements in a locus under balancing selection may reinforce polymor- phism by further promoting heterozygotes. Finally, according to recent genomewide scans, balanced polymorphism might be more pervasive than generally thought. We stress the need for both functional and ecological studies to characterize the evolutionary mechanisms operating in these systems.},

abstract = {Much is known about the evolution of dispersal when species interact with their resources or natural enemies, but very little is known about dispersal evolution when species interact with both resources and natural enemies. Here I investigate how the dispersal of an intermediate consumer evolves in response to its interactions with a basal resource and top predator. I find that dispersal evolution is possible even when the consumer species is not directly affected by environmental variability, but rather experiences the consequences that such variability has on its resource and predator. Spatial variation in the consumer's fitness is driven by spatial heterogeneity in resource productivity, which determines whether a predator can colonize a resource-consumer community. Temporal variation in the consumer's fitness is driven by random disturbances that cause periodic local extinctions of the predator, followed by recolonizations that lead to transient fluctuations in consumer abundance. When spatial variation in resource productivity is low and the predator can colonize all patches in the landscape, there is no spatial variation in consumer fitness but temporal variation in fitness favors the evolution of a dispersal monomorphism. When spatial variation in resource productivity is high and the predator cannot colonize many patches in the landscape, spatial variation in fitness selects against dispersal. In this case, temporal variation can promote the evolution of a dispersal polymorphism with sedentary and mobile phenotypes, but only for certain types of tri-trophic interactions. This finding underscores the importance of indirect interactions in shaping the evolution of dispersal. While the ecological community can provide a strong selective environment for the evolution of dispersal, the nature of interactions between trophic levels can also impose constraints on evolution.},

In How and Why Species Multiply, they offered a complete evolutionary history of Darwin's finches since their origin almost three million years ago. Now, in their richly illustrated new book, 40 Years of Evolution, the authors turn their attention to events taking place on a contemporary scale. By continuously tracking finch populations over a period of four decades, they uncover the causes and consequences of significant events leading to evolutionary changes in species. The authors used a vast and unparalleled range of ecological, behavioral, and genetic data--including song recordings, DNA analyses, and feeding and breeding behavior--to measure changes in finch populations on the small island of Daphne Major in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago. They find that natural selection happens repeatedly, that finches hybridize and exchange genes rarely, and that they compete for scarce food in times of drought, with the remarkable result that the finch populations today differ significantly in average beak size and shape from those of forty years ago. The authors' most spectacular discovery is the initiation and establishment of a new lineage that now behaves as a new species, differing from others in size, song, and other characteristics. The authors emphasize the immeasurable value of continuous long-term studies of natural populations and of critical opportunities for detecting and understanding rare but significant events. By following the fates of finches for several generations, 40 Years of Evolution offers unparalleled insights into ecological and evolutionary changes in natural environments.},

An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. 2. Here we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities, and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. 3. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. 4. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We discuss the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.},

We here test for life history divergence between threespine stickleback inhabiting Lake Constance (Central Europe) and multiple tributary streams. Otolith analysis shows that lake fish generally reproduce at two years of age, while their conspecifics in all streams have shifted to a primarily annual life cycle. This divergence is paralleled by a striking and consistent reduction in body size and fecundity in stream fish relative to lake fish. Stomach content analysis suggests that life history divergence might reflect a genetic or plastic response to pelagic versus benthic foraging modes in the lake and the streams. Microsatellite and mitochondrial markers further reveal that life history shifts in the different streams have occurred independently following the colonization by Lake Constance stickleback, and indicate the presence of strong barriers to gene flow across at least some of the lake-stream habitat transitions. Given that body size is known to strongly influence stickleback mating behavior, these barriers might well be related to life history divergence.},

abstract = {We modelled the total number of individuals of selected water insects based on a 30-year data set of population dynamics and environmental variables (discharge, temperature, precipitation, abundance of parental generation) in a small stream in central Germany. For data exploration, visualisation of data, outlier detection, hypothesis generation, and to detect basic patterns in the data, we used Kohonen's self organizing maps (SOM). They are comparable to statistical cluster analysis by ordinating data into groups. Based on annual abundance patterns of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), species groups with similar ecological requirements were distinguished. Furthermore, we applied linear neural networks, general regression neural networks, modified multi-layer perceptrons, and radial basis function networks combined with a SOM (RBFSOM) and successfully predicted the annual abundance of selected species from environmental variables. Results were visualised in three-dimensional plots. Relevance detection methods were sensitivity analysis, stepwise method and Genetic Algorithms. Instead of a sliding windows approach we computed the in- and output data of fixed periods for two caddis flies. In order to assess the quality of the models we applied several reliability measures and compared the generalisation error with the long-term mean of the target variable. RBFSOMs were used to denominate and visualise local and general model accuracy. Results were interpreted on the basis of known species traits. We conclude that it is possible to predict the abundance of aquatic insects based on relevant environmental factors using artificial neural networks. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Quantitative genetic theory provides a means of estimating the evolutionary potential of natural populations. However, this approach was previously only feasible in systems where the genetic relatedness between individuals could be inferred from pedigrees or experimental crosses. The genomic revolution opened up the possibility of obtaining the realized proportion of genome shared among individuals in natural populations of virtually any species, which could promise (more) accurate estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in virtually any species. Such a ‘genomic' quantitative genetics approach relies on fewer assumptions, offers a greater methodological flexibility, and is thus expected to greatly enhance our understanding of evolution in natural populations, for example, in the context of adaptation to environmental change, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and biodiversity conservation. Information about genetic (co)variances of traits is essential to understand and predict evolutionary change. This has gained additional importance in the light of contemporary human-induced environmental change to which species and populations need to adapt. Quantitative genetics studies genetic (co)variances based on the phenotypic resemblance of related individuals. Relatedness among individuals can be known from observed pedigrees or breeding experiments but such information can only be gathered for a limited range of species. The advances in genomics tools now allow us to genotype virtually any species for thousands of genomic markers. Relatedness estimates from such genomic markers have been used in human genetics as well as animal and plant breeding, but doing so also in wild populations has the potential to considerably advance our understanding of adaptation in the wild.},

The effects derived from the model demonstrated\nthat the time of snowmelt directly affected plant and arthropod\nphenology as well as the performance of all included trophic levels.\nAdditionally, timing of snowmelt appeared to indirectly influence wader\nphenology as well as plant, arthropod and wader performance through\neffects on adjacent trophic levels and lagged effects.

It extends to nonseparable weakly connected dynamic systems (cases not covered by the current Granger causality paradigm). The approach is illustrated both by simple models (where, in contrast to the real world, we know the underlying equations/relations and so can check the validity of our method) and by application to real ecological systems, including the controversial sardine-anchovy-temperature problem.},

- The authors seem to stress that observation of the dynamics of systems can be used to separate correlation from causation.
- They also state that apparent synchrony can be mistaken for causation. I see this as a possible explanation for the finch time series, when population and phenotypic change are coupled, possibly because of external forcing by weather.
- Does not seem to allow for rebuilding a causative map throughout the time series.
- I do not like the fact that it discusses causation disconnectedly from the biology of the systems, namely without demonstrating what this causality represents. It does not also seem to account for self dependence in dynamics. Also in the prey predator system it does not give the direction nor the shape of the interaction.
- Overall the algorithm is quite opaque but seems to build local temporal extrapolation of the two time series and look for predicting the effected states based on local changes in the potential effector state.
- I do not find this to be an intuitive way of thinking about causality.},

abstract = {Species in a common landscape often face similar selective environments. The capacity of organisms to adapt to these environments may be largely species specific. Quantifying shared and unique adaptive responses across species within landscapes may thus improve our understanding of landscape-moderated biodiversity patterns. Here we test to what extent populations of two coexisting and phylogenetically related fishes—three-spined and nine-spined stickleback—differ in the strength and nature of neutral and adaptive divergence along a salinity gradient. Phenotypic differentiation, neutral genetic differentiation and genomic signatures of adaptation are stronger in the three-spined stickleback. Yet, both species show substantial phenotypic parallelism. In contrast, genomic signatures of adaptation involve different genomic regions, and are thus non-parallel. The relative contribution of spatial and environmental drivers of population divergence in each species reflects different strategies for persistence in the same landscape. These results provide insight in the mechanisms underlying variation in evolutionary versatility and ecological success among species within landscapes.},

abstract = {In observational demographic data, the number of measured factors that could potentially drive demography (such as daily weather records between two censuses) can easily exceed the number of independent observations. Thus, identifying the important drivers requires alternatives to standard model selection and variable selection methods. Spline methods that estimate smooth functions over continuous domains (such as space or time) have the potential to resolve high-dimensional problems in ecological systems. We consider two examples that are important for many plant populations: competition with neighbours that vary in size and distance from the focal individual and climate variables during a window of time before a response (growth, survival, etc.) is measured. For competition covariates, we use a simulation study based on empirical data to show that a monotone spline estimate of competition kernels via approximate AIC returns very accurate estimates. We then apply the method to long-term, mapped quadrat data on the four dominant species in an Idaho (US) sagebrush steppe community. For climate predictors and their temporal lags, we use simulated data sets to compare functional smoothing methods with competing linear (LASSO) or machine learning (random forests) methods. Given sufficient data, functional smoothing methods outperformed the other two methods. Functional smoothing methods can advance data-driven population modelling by providing alternatives to specifying competition kernels a priori and to arbitrarily aggregating continuous environmental covariates. However, there are important open questions related to modelling of nonlinear climate responses and size × climate interactions.},

abstract = {Dispersal, whether in the form of a dandelion seed drifting on the breeze, or a salmon migrating upstream to breed in a nonnatal stream, transports genes between locations. At these locations, local adaptation modifies the gene frequencies so their carriers are better suited to particular conditions, be those of newly disturbed soil or a quiet river pool. Both dispersal and local adaptation are major drivers of population structure; however, in general, their respective roles are not independent and the two may often be at odds with one another evolutionarily, each one exhibiting negative feedback on the evolution of the other. Here, we investigate their joint evolution within a simple, discrete-time, metapopulation model. Depending on environmental conditions, their evolutionary interplay leads to either a monomorphic population of highly dispersing generalists or a collection of rarely dispersing, locally adapted, polymorphic sub-populations, each adapted to a particular habitat type. A critical value of environmental heterogeneity divides these two selection regimes and the nature of the transition between them is determined by the level of kin competition. When kin competition is low, at the transition we observe discontinuities, bistability, and hysteresis in the evolved strategies; however, when high, kin competition moderates the evolutionary feedback and the transition is smooth.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to change their phenotype in response to shifts in the environment. While a central topic in current discussions of evolutionary potential, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic underpinnings of plasticity is lacking in systems undergoing adaptive diversification. Here we investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in a textbook adaptive radiation, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. Specifically, we crossed two divergent species to generate an F3 hybrid mapping population. At early juvenile stages, hybrid families were split and reared in alternate foraging environments that mimicked benthic/scraping or limnetic/sucking modes of feeding. These alternate treatments produced variation in morphology that was broadly similar to the major axis of divergence among Malawi cichlids, providing support for the flexible stem theory of adaptive radiation. Next we found that the genetic architecture of several morphological traits was highly sensitive to the environment. In particular, of 22 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL), only one was shared between environments. In addition, we identified QTL acting across environments with alternate alleles being differentially sensitive to the environment. Thus, our data suggest that while plasticity is largely determined by loci specific to a given environment, it may also be influenced by loci operating across environments. Finally, our mapping data provide evidence for the evolution of plasticity via genetic assimilation at an important regulatory locus, ptch1. In all, our data address longstanding discussions about the genetic basis and evolution of plasticity. They also underscore the importance of the environment in affecting developmental outcomes, genetic architectures, morphological diversity, and evolutionary potential.

In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

abstract = {The functional response is a key element in all predator-prey interactions. Although functional responses are traditionally modelled as being a function of prey density only, evidence is accumulating that predator density also has an important effect. However, much of the evidence comes from artificial experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations by reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and suggest that a modified version of the Hassell-Varley predator interference model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation and applied modelling.},

- The authors talk about the risk of misquantifying an interaction because of a wrong choice of parametric function. This justifies using nonparametric functions.
- Useful paper to support the efficiency of interpolating the data first, looking at log densities to get per-capita growth rates.
- They smooth real data to get gradients, population growth rates, and then fit parametric and non parametric models to infer density dependence in growth rates.
- They had technical issues with the non parametric models and had to make them functions of single variables, which is a bummer. Overall the method looks quite complicated due to the use of splines. They also ran into problems comparing non parametric model constructions.
- They used cross validation to choose the degree of smoothing, which is good.
- They state that spatial dynamics is not really a cause of variation in dynamics, because in lab settings the population is well mixed and movements are random.
- Overall, they demonstrate the usefulness of non parametric methods for studying population dynamics as they are able to conclude about their hypothesis without knowing the adequate functional form.},

abstract = {Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between cli- mate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect inter- actions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer condi- tions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level. 637},

abstract = {Salmon life histories are finely tuned to local environmental conditions, which are intimately linked to climate. We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i.e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.},

- Response to climate change of Salmon might involve evolutionary change in upstream migration and spawning timing. In contrast, adaptation may also involve plastic changes in downstream migration traits, such as timing of emergence, smolting, and habitat choice.

- Could be interesting to highlight a system in which it is important to understand and forecast feedbacks.

abstract = {Mathematical models in biology are highly simplified representations of a complex underlying reality and there is always a high degree of uncertainty with regards to model function specification. This uncertainty becomes critical for models in which the use of different functions fitting the same dataset can yield substantially different predictions-a property known as structural sensitivity. Thus, even if the model is purely deterministic, then the uncertainty in the model functions carries through into uncertainty in model predictions, and new frameworks are required to tackle this fundamental problem. Here, we consider a framework that uses partially specified models in which some functions are not represented by a specific form. The main idea is to project infinite dimensional function space into a low-dimensional space taking into account biological constraints. The key question of how to carry out this projection has so far remained a serious mathematical challenge and hindered the use of partially specified models. Here, we propose and demonstrate a potentially powerful technique to perform such a projection by using optimal control theory to construct functions with the specified global properties. This approach opens up the prospect of a flexible and easy to use method to fulfil uncertainty analysis of biological models.},

abstract = {Although within a relatively short period man has learned how to put himself into space, he still is not certain how the numbers of a single plant or animal population are naturally controlled. Aspects of this problem have been investigated since Aristotle's time, they were given important consideration in Darwin's Origin of Species, and yet the unknowns far outweigh the discoveries. If we knew more about natural regulation of population, we would be in a better position to devise more effective and safer means of control for important populations of plant and animal pests. We might also be better able to limit the growth of human populations, although that problem is exceedingly complex because of the social activities and nature of man. Population Characteristics Before considering how populations in nature are regulated, we should review various characteristics of animals and plants-as individuals and as populations. Do populations of animals in nature fluctuate severely or are they relatively constant? Stability and constancy have been proposed as characteristics of natural populations. Speaking about birds, Lack (1) says, "of the species which are familiar to us in England today, most were familiar to our Victorian great-grandparents and many to our medieval ancestors; and the known changes in numbers are largely attributable to man." He continues , "All the available censuses confirm the view that, where conditions are 1432 not disturbed, birds fluctuate in numbers between very restricted limits. Thus, among the populations considered above, the highest total recorded was usually between two and six times, rarely as much as ten times, the lowest. This is a negligible range compared with what a geometric rate of increase would allow." Discussing the stability in animal populations in general, MacFadyen (2) writes: "it is generally agreed that the same species are usually found in the same habitats at the same seasons for many years in succession, and that they occur in numbers which are of the same order of magnitude." Further evidence for the thesis that species populations are relatively constant is found in a study of the changes in the fauna of Ontario, Canada (3). When Snyder (4) evaluated the bird fauna, he found that, over a period of about 70 years, two species became extinct , 23 species increased in number, and six species decreased in number. This represents a total change of only 9 percent of 351 bird species found in Ontario (5) and agrees favorably with an 11-percent change (6) for 149 species of birds over a 50-year period in Fin-land. These data suggest that there is relative constancy in the abundance of species populations. The word "relative" must be emphasized because changes in numbers must be related to a species' real potential for fluctuations; to para-The author is chairman of the department of entomology and limnology,},

abstract = {Organisms can change their environment and in doing so change the selection they experience and how they evolve. Population density is one potential mediator of such interactions because high population densities can impact the ecosystem and reduce resource availability. At present, such interactions are best known from theory and laboratory experiments. Here we quantify the importance of such interactions in nature by transplanting guppies from a stream where they co-occur with predators into tributaries that previously lacked both guppies and predators. If guppies evolve solely because of the immediate reduction in mortality rate, the strength of selection and rate of evolution should be greatest at the outset and then decline as the population adapts to its new environment. If indirect effects caused by the increase in guppy population density in the absence of predation prevail, then there should be a lag in guppy evolution because time is required for them to modify their environment. The duration of this lag is predicted to be associated with the environmental modification caused by guppies. We observed a lag in life-history evolution associated with increases in population density and altered ecology. How guppies evolved matched predictions derived from evolutionary theory that incorporates such density effects.},
annote = {Takeway:
- The authors evidence a change in guppy phenotype following a peak in population density, which provides evidence for density dependent selection at play. They further imply that this is evidence for indirect effects (i.e. ecosystem mediated effects) on evolution, as otherwise evolution would have proceeded directly uppon introduction of guppies in the stream.
- Overall, the authors provide support to the importance of indirect effects in driving evolution in natural systems.
- I would still see that as indirect evidence, qualitative evidence for such effects.


Notes:
- I do not like the angle of the paper at first glance: indirect effects are not the only reason why we might observe a lag in evolution, e.g. cryptic evolution which may involve direct effects. Therefore the hypothesis testing approach used here is not very convincing, compared to an approach that would directly quantify direct vs indirect effects.
- In this sense, I view this paper as an indirect proof for indirect feedback effects at play. This hence links up to the long list of indirect proofs and implications, e.g. Siepielski 2016 and Fryxell 2019.
- The author states the potential importance of indirect effects of evolution mediated through density dependent effects, which links up to the point made by Hendry 2019. The word potential is important and highlights the need for further investigations as those effects are not well understood, which is also stated by Hendry 2019.
- I view this study as a qualitative demonstration of the importance of indirect effects of evolution.
- introduced guppies in 4 streams, assessed age at maturity every year. This experiment is similar to the original but in a more controlled manner.
- They agree that this is indirect evidence given that many other factors can lead to lags, such as plasticity in early generations, or weak initial selection, caused by high resource availability for instance. The authors discuss those at length in the discussion (check the summary table). This is useful for a discussion.
- The author show that density by reducing offspring production reduces opportunites for selection, and hence potentially reduce the rate of the evolutionary response. This can be an example of mechanism for density dependent selection that justifies the quantification of density effects on phenotypic change.
- The authors argue that ecological consequences of guppy introduction, i.e. the depletion of resource, which create density-dependent selection.
- The authors state that LP and HP guppies interact in different ways with their environment, as LP guppies feed of both algae and invertebrates, while HP tend to be more specific predators of invertebrates.
- The authors state that while it's possible to whitness evolution at play, it is another thing to understand how it proceeds, which rejoins the points made by van Benthem et al. 2017, Hendry 2019, Brunner et al. 2019. Overall, we do not know really the mechanisms.
- This paper overall makes me realise that we do not understand the mechanisms that drive change in our ecosystems, and that they are all intricately linked.},

A simplistic view of the adaptive process pictures a hillside along which a population can climb: when ecological ‘demands' change, evolution ‘supplies' the variation needed for the population to climb to a new peak. Evolutionary ecologists point out that this simplistic view can be incomplete because the fitness landscape changes dynamically as the population evolves. Geneticists meanwhile have identified complexities relating to the nature of genetic variation and its architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under debate. In this review, we highlight how complexity in both ecological ‘demands' and the evolutionary ‘supply' influences organisms' ability to climb fitness landscapes that themselves change dynamically as evolution proceeds, and encourage new synthetic effort across research disciplines towards ecologically realistic studies of adaptation.},

Interpreting and reconciling these contradictions has been challenging due to the inherent complexity of model dynamics, defying mathematical analysis and mechanistic understanding. We develop a new approach here, based on the Geber method for deconstructing eco-evolutionary dynamics, for gaining such understanding. We apply this approach to a co-evolutionary predator-prey model to disentangle the processes leading to either antiphase or ¼-lag cycles. Our analysis reveals how the predator-prey phase relationship is driven by the temporal synchronization between prey biomass and defense dynamics. We further show when and how prey biomass and trait dynamics become synchronized, resulting in antiphase cycles, allowing us to explain and reconcile previous modelling and empirical predictions. The successful application of our proposed approach provides an important step towards a comprehensive theory on eco-evolutionary feedbacks in predator-prey systems.},

abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary processes may interact on the same timescale, but we are just beginning to understand how. Several studies have examined the net effects of adaptive evolution on ecosystem properties. However, we do not know whether these effects are confined to direct interactions or whether they propagate further through indirect ecological pathways. Even less well understood is how the combination of direct and indirect ecological effects of the phenotype promotes or inhibits evolutionary change. We coupled mesocosm experiments and ecosystem modeling to evaluate the ecological effects of local adaptation in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). The experiments show that guppies adapted to life with and without predators alter the ecosystem directly through differences in diet. The ecosystem model reveals that the small total indirect effect of the phenotype observed in the experiments is likely a combination of several large indirect effects that act in opposing directions. The model further suggests that these indirect effects can reverse the direction of selection that direct effects alone exert back on phenotypic variation. We conclude that phenotypic divergence can have major effects deep in the web of indirect ecological interactions and that even small total indirect effects can radically change the dynamics of adaptation.},
annote = {Takeaway
- it is still unclear how effects of evolution of focal traits/species propagate through indirect ecological pathways.
- The authors modelling work suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of guppies are the result of indirect effects through nutrient recycling.
- State that it is unclear whether dynamics in communities are determined by direct effects of indirect effects, and of which size. This is in line with the study by Barraclough et al. 2015.
- They state that there is not single system where the characterisation of feedbacks (direct and indirect effects) have been fully characterised.
- This study shows that dynamical effects can only be understood in light of other dynamical effects, because of compensation by indirect effects. This reinforces the need for integrative studies.

Note
- This supports the statements made by Hendry, and Van Benthem (?), regarding the fact that we do not know about more complicated feedbacks that do not solely involve population dynamics.
- I can use this study as an example of ODe model fitting to the guppy system. But state that they did not model eco-evolutionary dynamics because they did not model the dynamics of the phenotype explicitly. They only revealed the ecological architecture.

To build a research workflow for integrating insights into spatiotemporal dynamics of species-rich systems, we focus on the roles of ‘metacommunity hub' species, whose population size and/or genetic dynamics potentially control landscape- or regional-scale phenomena. As large amounts of net-work data are becoming available with high-throughput sequencing of various host–symbiont, prey–predator, and symbiont–symbiont interactions, we suggest it is now possible to develop bases for the integrated understanding and management of species-rich ecosystems. 地球上の人口が増え続ける中、食糧を安定的に供給する上で、また、進行する数々の環境問題に対処する上で、生態系に関する知識がますます重要性を増してきています。しかし、無数の生物種が複雑に関係し合う生態系を研究する際、「まずどの種から研究すべきか」決めること自体に困難が伴います。 本研究ではまず、生物種間の関係における「物理的接触」に着目し、DNA情報に基づく相互作用の情報を大量に得る技術を基本としました。例えば、肉食動物の糞や腹のサンプルには、肉食動物自体のDNAとともに食べた餌種のDNAも含まれています。こうしたDNAに関する情報を集めれば、食う－食われる関係や共生・寄生関係に関する大規模な「ネットワーク構造」を推定することができます。このネットワークの情報があれば、どの種がより多くの他種と関わっている「ハブ」なのか、把握することができます。 しかし、たとえ1ヶ所の生態系でハブであったとしても、別の地域の生態系では、他の種がハブになっているかもしれません。そこで本研究グループは、「幅広い地域の生態系において繰り返しハブとして出現する種」を選別する方法を提案しました。この手法で定義される「ハブ生物種」は、幅広い地域に渡って多数の生物種の生態や進化に影響を及ぼしている可能性があり、今後重点的に研究することで、生態系全体の動態に関する理論や応用技術が発展すると期待されます。 従来の研究では、個々の研究者が限られた生物群のみを対象としてきており、生態系全体の構造に関する知見が限られてきました。しかし、生物であれば必ず持っているDNAの情報を用いることで、一人の研究者が生態系全体の動態を研究できる時代が拓かれつつあります。今回提案した手法を用いれば、対象となる生物群集の全体構造を研究の初期段階において一挙に解明し、数百・数千の生物種の中から重点的に研究予算と労力を投入すべき種を選ぶことができます。今後は、この手法で選別された種が実際に重要な働きをしているのか、検証研究を展開していく予定です。},

- Ecological complexity is not accounted for in investigations of eco-evo feedbacks.
- Methodological constraints prevented us from understanding eco-evo feedbacks in real context.
- Identifying key stone species is a way to deal with complexity of ecological networks. But difficult to identify them.
- Communities are webs of co-evolving species.

4. Discussion
- The author proposes to use network theory to picture the ecological architecture, and centrality to identity keystone species.
- Meta barcoding is going to further our ability to picture complex ecological networks of interactions in the wild.
- Transcriptomics is going to further our ability to picture gene expression in the wild.
- Combination of meta barcoding and meta transcriptomics will allow to identify changes in species abundances, allele abundances in time.},

abstract = {Populations often contain discrete classes or morphs (e.g., sexual dimorphisms, wing dimorphisms, trophic dimorphisms) characterized by distinct patterns of trait expression. In quantitative genetic analyses, the different morphs can be considered as different environments within which traits are expressed. Genetic variances and covariances can then be estimated independently for each morph or in a combined analysis. In the latter case, morphs can be considered as sepa- rate environments in a bivariate analysis or entered as fixed effects in a univari- ate analysis. Although a common approach, we demonstrate that the latter produces downwardly biased estimates of additive genetic variance and herita- bility unless the quantitative genetic architecture of the traits concerned is per- fectly correlated between the morphs. This result is derived for four widely used quantitative genetic variance partitioning methods. Given that theory pre- dicts the evolution of genotype-by-environment (morph) interactions as a con- sequence of selection favoring different trait combinations in each morph, we argue that perfect correlations between the genetic architectures of the different morphs are unlikely. A sampling of the recent literature indicates that the majority of researchers studying traits expressed in different morphs recognize this and do estimate morph-specific quantitative genetic architecture. However, ca. 16% of the studies in our sample utilized only univariate, fixed-effects mod- els. We caution against this approach and recommend that it be used only if supported by evidence that the genetic architectures of the different morphs do not differ.},

abstract = {So far a considerable number of studies have been carried out on estimating parameters and completing imperfect parts of dynamical equations of an ecological system from a set of observation data. This paper presents a new method for such purposes by using a multi-layer neural network with residual minimization training, where an object function composed of a sum of squared residuals of supposed governing equations at collocation points and squared deviations of the solutions from observation data is minimized. Firstly, we applied this method to analysis of "model observation data" produced by numerical integration of equations of a predator-prey system. As a result the parameters included in the model equations are recovered with considerably high accuracy even when artificial random noises are added to the original solutions. Then, we applied it successfully to real time-series data of protozoan populations. It is concluded that the new method can be effectively applied to analyses of time-series data in the field of the ecological science. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

- Quite interesting, they apply the method of approximating the solution of the ODE with an ANN, then inferring the parameter values of a known equation given the approximated solution... or something like that... You should read it more carefully.
- It constitutes a nice example of application of ANN to solving an ODE system modelling ecological dynamics.
- The difference to your work is that they assume a priori knowledge about the ecology of the system. They do not use the neural network to find it... Quite different.
- The networks are not embedded within the mathematical framework, it's a bit like an approach in steps.
- It's quite unclear still, but it seems that it is exactly what you do => what you need to do is present it as a first attempt, and find reasons why it's not good enough.

abstract = {The relationship between population density and sexual reproduction is explored for planktonic rotifer populations. It has been argued that selection favors sex at population maxima because of favorable probabilities of encounter. Factors determining the probability of encounter are examined. Experimentally determined parameters for males and females (swimming speed, duration of fertility, net fecundity, and encounter distance) are used to investigate density effects on the probability of encounter. As population density increases, the probability of encounter also increases sigmoidally. The probability of a female encountering a male during her fertile period begins to increase rapidly at ≈ 50 males/1. The increase continues until it becomes asymptotic at ≈ 1000 males/1, where the probability of a female encountering, at least one male during her fertile period approaches one. The duration of female fertility is less than that of males, causing the female curve to be displaced toward higher population densities. Critical density, the population density where Ro′ is exactly equal to one, for males and females is 11.7 and 141 individuals/1, respectively. The precision of the model was evaluated by observing the frequency of male-female encounters during 212 5-min observation periods. The observed encounter rate was 1.49/min, compared to a predicted rate of 1.53/ min. These values are not significantly different as determined by t-test. The constraints placed on the timing of sex by population density are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {Demographic stochasticity is almost universally modeled as sampling variance in a homogeneous population, although it is defined as arising from random variation among individuals. This can lead to serious misestimation of the extinction risk in small populations. Here, we derive analytical expressions showing that the misestimation for each demographic parameter is exactly (in the case of survival) or approximately (in the case of fecundity) proportional to the among-individual variance in that parameter. We also show why this misestimation depends on systematic variation among individuals, rather than random variation. These results indicate that correctly assessing the importance of demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the variance in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative shape (convex or concave) of the mean-variance relationship; and (3) information on the mechanisms generating among-individual variation. An important consequence is that almost all population viability analyses (PVAs) overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity and, therefore, the risk of extinction.},

At the landscape scale, across eight streams in the Caroni drainage, we found that the presence of locally adapted populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) is associated with reduced algal biomass and increased invertebrate biomass, while the opposite trends were true in streams with experimentally introduced populations of non-locally adapted guppies. Exclusion experiments conducted in two separate reaches of a single stream showed that guppies with locally adapted phenotypes significantly reduced algae with no effect on invertebrates, while non-adapted guppies had no effect on algae but significantly reduced invertebrates. These divergent effects of phenotype on stream ecosystems are comparable in strength to the effects of abiotic factors (e.g., light) know...},

- LP phenotype eats algae, not so much invertebrates. HP has opposite effects. This demonstrates the importance of phenotypic change for ecological dynamics.

- This is a good example of an indirect evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, not identifying the actual nature of the relationship between the two.

Note:
- As a general critique, again I would think that this is indirect evidence for feedbacks as they are only concerned with the outcome of the dynamics: LP phenotype leads to a change in the state of the ecosystem (lower standing algae, higher standing invertebrates), which implies a change in the interaction with its environment, and hence potentially of effects between ecology and evolution. It that not clarify the nature of the relationship, it hints at it.

1. Introduction

- Ecology and evolution often studied in isolation.
- Eco-evolutionary dynamics refer to fast evolution interplaying with ecological dynamics.
- Very few empirical evidence for full eco-evo feedbacks.
- One implication identifying eefbl is better forecast of response to climate change, species invasion, etc.
- Spatial structure of the population and the environment is critical to not misread evolutionary and or ecological dynamics. Genetic control of dispersal is a good candidate to look for eco-evo feedback loop.
- Evolution depends on both the rate of change of the environment (i.e. selective pressures) and of the genetic structure, characterizing both is fundamental.
- Genetic architecture shapes the dynamics of genetic variation and hence that of response to selection.

4. Discussion
- Evolution and Ecology are still not coupled enough.
- must strengthen ability to identify the genetic architecture of ecologically relevant traits, and how it influences the dynamics of genetic variation.
- Not enough empirical evidence: identify feedback loops in the wild, and UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THEIR COMPLEXITY.
- Important to forcast the impact of anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that evolutionary changes can occur on a contemporary time scale. Hence, evolution can influence ecology and vice-versa. To understand the impor- tance of eco-evolutionary dynamics in population dynamics, wemust quantify the relative con- tribution of ecological and evolutionary changes to population growth and other ecological processes. To date, however, most eco-evolutionary dynamics studies have not partitioned the relative contribution of plastic and evolutionary changes in traits on population, community, and ecosystem processes. Here, we quantify the effects of heritable and non-heritable changes in body mass distribution on survival, recruitment, and population growth in wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and compare their importance to the effects of changes in age struc- ture, population density, and weather.We applied a combination of a pedigree-based quantita- tive genetics model, statistical analyses of demography, and a new statistical decomposition technique, the Geber method, to a long-term data set of bighorn sheep on Ram Mountain (Canada), monitored individually from 1975 to 2012. We show three main results: (1) The relative importance of heritable change in mass, non-heritable change in mass, age structure, density, and climate on population growth rate changed substantially over time. (2) An increase in body mass was accompanied by an increase in population growth through higher survival and recruitment rate. (3) Over the entire study period, changes in the body mass distribution of ewes, mostly through non-heritable changes, affected population growth to a similar extent as changes in age structure or in density. The importance of evolutionary changes was small compared to that of other drivers of changes in population growth but increased with time as evolutionary changes accumulated. Evolutionary changes became increasingly important for population growth as the length of the study period considered increased. Our results highlight the complex ways in which ecological and evolutionary changes can affect population dynamics and illustrate the large potential effect of trait changes on population processes.},
annote = {- This quantified empirically contributions of heritable and non-heritable changes, as well as demographic and environmental factors, to the growth rate of a population of large herbivores. They found the relative contribution of each factors varies greatly in time. Non evolutionary changes (e.g. changes in body length plasticity, age distribution, density, weather) were the greatest contributors to population dynamics, followed by heritable changes to body mass.

- This study provides an interesting attempt to dissect empirically, from a time series, the architecture of a feedback. While it hints that a feedback is likely at play, as ecological and evolutionary component contribute to population dynamics, it does not really provide a mechanism. To my mind this shows the limit of a purely empirical approach. 

- The takeaway is thus that, it hints eco-evo feedbacks, but we a more integrated mechanistic theoretical framework to really characterise the structure of the feedback in an understandable way. This if nothing else, is a perfect example that feedbacks are really messy.},

This tight link between ecology and evolution is of fundamental importance as it can determine the stability of populations and communities, as well as the generation and maintenance of diversity within and among populations. Although these eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks have now been demonstrated many times, we are still far away from understanding how often they occur in nature. We summarize recent findings on eco-evolutionary dynamics, with a focus on consumer-resource interactions, from theory and empirical research. We identify gaps in our knowledge and suggest future research directions to provide a mechanistic understanding and predictive capability for community and ecosystem responses to environmental change.},
annote = {Takeaway
- The authors state that eco-evolutionary feedbacks are known to exist, but that we still need to evidence them in nature and determine how often they occur.
- The authors show conceptually how the genetic structure of the defense trait of the prey is influencing the nature of the prey-predator oscillations.
- They state that eco-evolutionary feedbacks are highly complex processes.},

abstract = {Evidence of reciprocal influences between ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) is accumulating at different levels of biological organisation, ranging from populations to communities and even ecosystems. This special feature showcases the state-of-the art knowledge on eco-evolutionary dynamics and dissects the feedback types, the biological and spatial scales as well as the agents of selection underlying the interactions between ecology and evolution. Theoretical approaches to eco-evolutionary feedbacks can draw on a wide range of fields and have a long history within evolutionary ecology. The integration of theoretical approaches from quantitative genetics, evolutionary ecology, and metapopulation ecology is necessary to advance our understanding of rapid evolution and associated eco-evolutionary dynamics. Empirical studies in this special feature focus on the evolution-to-ecology pathway by which evolutionary processes influence ecological dynamics (the direction in eco-evolutionary dynamics less well studied). Advancing towards the study of complete (i.e. reciprocal) eco-evolutionary feedbacks requires unravelling both the ecology-to-evolution and the evolution-to-ecology pathways in isolation and understanding how they are coupled. This endeavour will require a combination of laboratory, semi-natural (e.g. mesocosm) and field studies. As the field of eco-evolutionary dynamics matures, it moves from proof-of-principle studies to understanding increasingly complex biological systems. This Special Feature provides necessary tools and approaches, both theoretical and empirical, to achieve this new aim.},
annote = {takeaways:
- need to quantify actual feedbacks, bothe eco-evo and evo-eco
- tackle natural systems, where complexity and context depdendence are 

Notes:
- most work has focussed on the evolution to ecology pathway => need work closing the feedback.
- context dependent nature of eco-evolutionary feedbacks; e.g. different environments can lead to different feedbacks
- points at the need for integrating the different dynamical components of eco-evolutionary dynamics identified to date (e.g. prey-predator coevolution and intra-specific competition)
- points at the need for more realism into eco-evolutionary dynamics, as mentionned in De Meester et al. 2019, Hendry 2019
- Points at the difficulty of understanding mechanisms in natural systems. This was also pointed by Hendry 2019, van Benthem 2017. This feeds into the chicken and eggy problem of current methods for estimating evolutionary effect sizes of the drivers of evolution, which are contingent on knowing the mechanisms for evolution, which are contingent on knowing the drivers. Actually there are two chicken and egg problem, that with inferring feedbacks (the "dynamical" chicken and egg problem), and that with mechanisms and effects (the "mechanistic").
- Feedbacks have not been quantified yet actually. This is also pointed out indirectly by Hendry 2019, who states that indirect effects of trait change (e.g. through demography might be more important).
- On that last point, the author touch specifically on that dynamical chicken and egg problem: the links between eco-evo and evo-eco pathways are a function of the dynamics, which itself is a function of the links.
- environmental context can influence the feebdack effects.
- I see this as a useful paper for your rotifer paper in that it demonstrates different evolutionary dynamics in different context.},

abstract = {1. Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. 3. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. 4. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. 5. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.

abstract = {The spatial configuration and size of patches influence metapopulation dynamics by altering colonisation–extinction dynamics and local density dependency. This spatial forcing as determined by the metapopulation typology then imposes strong selection pressures on life-history traits, which will in turn feed back on the ecological metapopulation dynamics. Given the relevance of metapopulation persistence for biological conservation, and the potential rescuing role of evolution, a firm understanding of the relevance of these eco-evolutionary processes is essential. We here follow a systems' modelling approach to quantify the importance of spatial forcing and experimentally observed life-history evolution for metapopulation demography as quantified by (meta)population size and variability. We therefore developed an individual-based model matching an earlier experimental evolution with spider mites to perform virtual translocation and invasion experiments that would have been otherwise impossible to conduct. We show that (a) metapopulation demography is more affected by spatial forcing than by life-history evolution, but that life-history evolution contributes substantially to changes in local- and especially metapopulation-level population sizes, (b) extinction rates are minimised by evolution in classical metapopulations, and (c) evolution is optimising individual performance in metapopulations when considering the importance of more cryptic stress resistance evolution. Ecological systems' modelling opens up a promising avenue to quantify the importance of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in spatially structured populations. Metapopulation sizes are especially impacted by evolution, but its variability is mainly determined by the spatial forcing. Eco-evolutionary dynamics can increase the persistence of classical metapopulations. Conservation of genetic variation and, hence, adaptive potential is thus not only essential in the face of environmental change; it also generates putative rescuing feedbacks that impact metapopulation persistence.},

- they know the genetic basis of the trait (i.e. coloration of the stick insect), they know the origin and strength of selective pressures. Thus they evidence that their trait is genetically encoded, that it is under strong selection, and that it influences the growth of the stick insect population. They even demonstrate changes in allelic frequencies. 

- They claim that evolution is very unpredictable, even when the components of the feedback are known. They also exemplify that in other systems. Except in moths maybe.

- Overall, it is a nice example of a clearly documented genetic architecture that underlies a feedback. Yet, the ecological part of the feedback is not clearly documented (as it is a field experiment). In addition, they use ARMA models to assess predictability... highly phenomenological. 

- The takeaway here is that this is a nice example of well resolved genetic architecture, and not well resolved ecological architecture. This further highlights that even feedbacks with simple genetic architecture may be complicated to characterise. It also calls for a more mechanistic predictive framework.},

abstract = {The risk of extinction faced by small isolated populations in changing environments can be reduced by rapid adaptation and subsequent growth to larger, less vulnerable sizes. Whether this process, called evolutionary rescue, is able to reduce extinction risk and sustain population growth over multiple generations is largely unknown. To understand the consequences of adaptive evolution as well as maladaptive processes in small isolated populations, we subjected experimental Tribolium castaneum populations founded with 10 or 40 individuals to novel environments, one more favorable, and one resource poor, and either allowed evolution, or constrained it by replacing individuals one-for-one each generation with those from a large population maintained in the natal environment. Replacement individuals spent one generation in the target novel environment before use to standardize effects due to the parental environment. After eight generations we mixed a subset of surviving populations to facilitate admixture, allowing us to estimate drift load by comparing performance of mixed to unmixed groups. Evolving populations had reduced extinction rates, and increased population sizes in the first four to five generations compared to populations where evolution was constrained. Performance of evolving populations subsequently declined. Admixture restored their performance, indicating high drift load that may have overwhelmed the beneficial effects of adaptation in evolving populations. Our results indicate that evolution may quickly reduce extinction risk and increase population sizes, but suggest that relying solely on adaptation from standing genetic variation may not provide long-term benefits to small isolated populations of diploid sexual species, and that active management facilitating gene flow may be necessary for longer term persistence.},

Though the adaptive population does better, they show that the adaptive capacity decreases over time. This shows that adaptation is limited by genetic load.

- This is another paper pointing at the importance of accounting for evolutionary adaptation in ecological dyanmcis. And which further shows that accounting for the dynamics of the genetic structure is paramount given that is likely a constraining factor.

- If nothing else they show that that this is likely a ubiquitous feature of feedbacks in isolated populations. You can use this paper to justify that you model a decrease in the genetic poo.},

The article deals with testing of the developed algorithm through solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Artificial neural networks are widely used for solving problems of mathematical physics; however, their use for modeling of hydrodynamic problems is very limited. At the same time, the problem of hydrodynamic modeling can be solved through neural network modeling and our study demonstrates an example of its solution.
