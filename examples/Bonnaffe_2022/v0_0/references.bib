   abstract = {Recent investigations have shown that processes within the planktonic microbial web are of great significance for the functioning of limnetic ecosystems. However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it. Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates, small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids) seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web. Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {can give rise to spurious diagnosis of second-order feedback effects (de-layed density dependence). They go on to warn that diagnosis of the underlying causes of population dynamics from time-series data is ''at best tenuous and may be impossible.'' This pessimistic conclusion is based on simulations with a first-order single-species population model (the Ricker ''logistic'' equation) in which the exogenous driving variable is strongly au-tocorrelated. Analysis of data generated by this model indicates that spurious second-order effects can be detected if the autocorrelation in the exogenous variable is strong while endogenous feedback is weak. The point raised by Williams and Liebhold (1995) is legitimate, and has been discussed previously by Royama (1981). However, we argue that Williams and Liebhold overstate the importance of this potential problem. Two points need to be considered in order to put Williams and Liebhold's argument in its proper perspective. 1) The results presented in Table 1 of Williams and Liebhold (1995: 1006) give a misleading impression that spurious second-order effects occur frequently for most combinations of parameters likely to be encountered in analyzing real data. This impression results from their restriction of the range of the maximum per capita rate-of-change parameter, r, to values between 0.1 and 0.7, where spurious effects are more likely to be observed in simulated data. However, the value of r estimated from forest insect and small-mammal population data (these are the taxa that most frequently show second-order effects) typically exceeds unity. For Manuscript example, estimates of the maximum annual per capita rates of change of 19 forest insect populations ranged from 0.58 to 4.27 with 90% being 1 (Berryman 1995), while the intrinsic rates of change of small-mammal populations were estimated to be between 2.7 and 5.4 (Hanski and Korpimaki 1995). (Note that estimates of r from multiple-regression models may not accurately reflect the maximum value of r, so direct measurements from the time series, as done by Berryman [1995] and Hanski and Korpimäki [1995], are preferable.) Williams and Liebhold acknowledge that the number of spurious second-order cases decreases as r increases. Hence, spurious second-order effects seem less likely to be encountered in real data than Williams and Lieb-hold (1995) imply. In addition, Williams and Liebhold used simulated time series that are longer than those usually encountered in practice (50 yr vs. the 10-30 yr typical of ecological data). Having longer time series gives one greater power in detecting weak statistical effects. Thus, the proportion of significantly spurious second-order effects in Table 1 probably overestimates the probability of finding such a spurious result in real applications. Finally, spurious second-order effects are primarily observed when autocorrelation in the exog-enous variable is strong (i.e., 0.3), which brings us to our second point. 2) Williams and Liebhold fail to demonstrate why we should frequently find strongly autocorrelated ex-ogenous driving variables in ecological systems. By definition, an exogenous variable is one that affects the variable of interest (the population) but is unaffected by that variable. Williams and Liebhold state that weather is the most likely exogenous factor affecting field populations, but then concede that annual weather patterns show little (if any) autocorrelation. Because annual weather fluctuations are not strongly autocor-related, and as most time-series analyses are performed on annual counts, weather would seem to be an unlikely candidate for creating spurious second-order effects in ecological time-series counts. Williams and Liebhold then suggest that generalist predators could act as exogenous factors. However, generalist predators do not normally fit the definition of an exogenous variable because they often respond behaviorally (and sometimes numerically) to the density of their prey (Holling 1965). Behavioral responses of generalist predators to the density of their prey, such as increased consumption, switching, and spatial ag-gregation, occur on a fast time scale, resulting in powerful first-order endogenous feedback on the prey population (Berryman 1981, Berryman et al. 1987). It is possible, of course, for generalist predators to act independently of the density of one prey species. Under},

   abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles. Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics. We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters , both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques. Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as ''probes.'' The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nich-olson's blowfly populations, in which we know the ''true'' governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

Although functional responses are traditionally modelled as being a function of prey density only, evidence is accumulating that predator density also has an important effect. However, much of the evidence comes from artificial experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations by reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and suggest that a modified version of the Hassell-Varley predator interference model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation and applied modelling.},

They are comparable to statistical cluster analysis by ordinating data into groups. Based on annual abundance patterns of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), species groups with similar ecological requirements were distinguished. Furthermore, we applied linear neural networks, general regression neural networks, modified multi-layer perceptrons, and radial basis function networks combined with a SOM (RBFSOM) and successfully predicted the annual abundance of selected species from environmental variables. Results were visualised in three-dimensional plots. Relevance detection methods were sensitivity analysis, stepwise method and Genetic Algorithms. Instead of a sliding windows approach we computed the in- and output data of fixed periods for two caddis flies. In order to assess the quality of the models we applied several reliability measures and compared the generalisation error with the long-term mean of the target variable. RBFSOMs were used to denominate and visualise local and general model accuracy. Results were interpreted on the basis of known species traits.

   abstract = {Models are useful when they are compared with data. Whether this comparison should be qualitative or quantitative depends on circumstances, but in many cases some statistical comparison of model and data is useful and enhances objectivity. Unfortunately, ecological dynamic models tend to contain assumptions and simplifications that enhance tractability, promote insight, but spoil model fit, and this can cause difficulties when adopting a statistical approach. Furthermore, the arcane numerical analysis required to fit dynamic models reliably presents an impediment to objective model testing by fitting. This paper presents methods for formulating and fitting partially specified models, which aim to achieve a measure of generality by avoiding some of the irrelevant incidental assumptions that are inevitable in more traditional approaches. This is done by allowing delay differential equation models, difference equation models, and differential equation models to be constructed with part of their structure represented by unknown functions, while part of the structure may contain conventional model elements that contain only unknown parameters. An integrated practical methodology for using such models is presented along with several examples, which include use of models formulated using delay differential equations, discrete difference equations/matrix models, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations. The methods also allow better estimation from ecological data by model fitting, since models can be formulated to include fewer unjustified assumptions than would usually be the case if more traditional models were used, while still including as much structure as the modeler believes can be justified by biological knowledge: model structure improves precision, while fewer extraneous assumptions reduce unquantifiable bias.},

Half of the populations were exposed to sublethal dosages of the toxic compound cadmium acetate; the remaining populations were considered controls. Initial density was low for half of the populations in each group, and high for the other half. In all populations, the adult abundance underwent sustained fluctuations. However, cadmium-exposed populations had smaller mean larval and adult densities, and fluctuations in adult abundance were less regular than for controls. Data from the first and the second half of the experimental period were analyzed separately in order to assess the effects of possible long-term changes in the dynamics on the estimates. Nonparametric (generalized) additive modeling (GAM) was used to investigate time series dynamics and, in particular, to explore the density-independent components and the structure of the density-dependent components of the system. Overall, cadmium populations had larger larva-to-adult survival rate and smaller adult survival rate than control populations, and for the second half of the experimental period the reproductive rate was smaller for cadmium populations than for control populations. Estimation of the density-dependent components suggested that survival from larva to adult depended nonlinearly on larval density and that increased larval density had a positive effect on larval survival at low densities. Furthermore, cadmium generally decreased vital rates. However, the analysis suggested that most of the observed differences in dynamical behavior between control and cadmium populations are related to differences in the density-independent components of the demographic rates, rather than differences in the density-dependent structure.},

   abstract = {Availability of food may play a number of different dynamical roles in rodent-vegetation systems. Consideration of a suite of rodent-vegetation models, ranging from very simple ones to a model of medium complexity tailored to a specific system (brown lemmings at Point Barrow, Alaska, USA), suggested several general principles. If vegetation grows logistically following an herbivory event (a standard assumption of previously advanced models for herbivore-plant interactions), then almost any biologically reasonable combinations of parameters characterizing rodent-vegetation systems would result in population cycles. We argue, however, that the assumption of logistic growth of the food supply may be appropriate for only a few species, such as moss-eating lemmings. The dynamics of food supply for many arvicoline (microtine) rodents may be better described by a ''linear initial regrowth'' model, which exhibits globally stable dynamics. If this is so, quantitative interactions with food supply are unlikely to explain multiannual population cycles for most boreal or temperate voles. The role of food in population dynamics , however, is not limited to its potential to generate cycles. A tritrophic model including vegetation, rodents, and their specialist predators suggests that food limitation may provide direct density dependence needed for sustained oscillations in this system (which is usually modeled by a phenomenological logistic term in the prey equation). We relate the general theory that we developed to one specific system where we have enough data to arrive at reasonable estimates for most of the parameters-brown lemmings at Point Barrow. The Barrow model exhibits oscillations of the approximately correct period and amplitude, thus giving some theoretical support to the food hypothesis. Nevertheless, we suggest that this result should be treated cautiously because key events explaining the population cycle in the model occur during winter, but winter biology of lemmings is still poorly understood.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis that the regular multiannual population oscillations of boreal and arctic small rodents (voles and lemmings) are driven by predation is as old as the scientific study of rodent cycles itself. Subsequently, for several decades, the predation hypothesis fell into disrepute, possibly because the views about predation and rodent dynamics were too simplistic. Here we review the work that has been done on the predation hypothesis primarily in Fennoscandia over the past decade. Models of predator-prey interaction have been constructed for the least weasel (Mustela nivalis) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis), which are considered to be the key specialist predator and the key prey species in the multispecies communities in the boreal forest region in Fennoscandia. The basic model has been parameterized with independent field data, and it predicts well the main features of the observed dynamics. An extension of the model also including generalist and nomadic avian predators predicts correctly the well-documented and striking geographic gradient in rodent oscillations in Fennoscandia, with the amplitude and cycle period decreasing from north to south. These geographic changes are attributed to the observed latitudinal change in the density of generalist and nomadic predators, which are expected to have a stabilizing effect on rodent dynamics. We review the other observational, modeling, and experimental results bearing on the predation hypothesis and conclude that it accounts well for the broad patterns in rodent oscillations in Fennoscandia. We discuss the application of the predation hypothesis to other regions in the northern hemisphere. The predation hypothesis does not make predictions about multiannual and latitudinal changes in body size, behavior, and demography of rodents , which may have some population-dynamic consequences. With the current evidence, however, we consider it unlikely that the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations would be instrumental for generating the broad patterns in rodent oscillations.},

However, in the long term evolution is unpredictable because environments, which determine the directions and magnitudes of selection coefficients, fluctuate unpredictably. These two features of evolution, the predictable and unpredictable, are demonstrated in a study of two populations of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change.},

   abstract = {The interpretation of ecological data has been greatly improved by bridging the gap between ecological and statistical models. The major challenge is to separate competing hypotheses concerning demography, or other ecological relationships, and environmental variability (noise). In this paper we demonstrate that this may be an arduous, if not impossible, task. It is the lack of adequate ecological theory, rather than statistical sophistication, which leads to this problem. A reconstruction of underlying ecological processes can only be done if we are certain of either the demographic or the noise model, which is something that can only be achieved by an improved theory of stochastic ecological processes. Ignoring the fact that this is a real problem may mislead ecologists and result in erroneous conclusions about the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous factors in natural ecosystems. The lack of correct model identification may also have far-reaching consequences for population management and conservation.},

   abstract = {For populations with a density-dependent life history reproducing at discrete annual intervals, we analyze small or moderate fluctuations in population size around a stable equilibrium, which is applicable to many vertebrate populations. Using a life history having age at maturity a, with stochasticity and density dependence in adult recruitment and mortality, we derive a linearized autoregressive equation with time lags from 1 to a yr. Contrary to current interpretations, the coefficients corresponding to different time lags in the autoregressive dynamics are not simply measures of delayed density dependence but also depend on life-history parameters. The theory indicates that the total density dependence in a life history, D, should be defined as the negative elasticity of population growth rate per generation with respect to change in population size, , where l is the asymptotic multiplicative growth T D p ln l/ ln N rate per year, T is the generation time, and N is adult population size. The total density dependence in the life history, D, can be estimated from the sum of the autoregression coefficients. We estimate D in populations of seven vertebrate species for which life-history studies and unusually long time series of complete population$15.00 All rights reserved. censuses are available. Estimates of D were statistically significant and large, on the order of 1 or higher, indicating strong density dependence in five of the seven species. We also show that life history can explain the qualitative features of population autocorrelation functions and power spectra and observations of increasing empirical variance in population size with increasing length of time series.},

   abstract = {1. In this review, we focus on how males can affect the population dynamics of ungu-lates (i) by being a component of population density (and thereby affecting interpretation of log-linear models), and (ii) by considering the mechanisms by which males can actively affect the demographic rates of females. 2. We argue that the choice of measure of density is important, and that the inclusion or exclusion of males into models can influence results. For example, we demonstrate that if the dynamics of a population can be described with a first-order auto-regressive process in a log-linear framework, the asymmetry between the effects of females on the male dynamics and vice versa can introduce a second order process, much in the same way that the interaction between disease and host or predator and prey can. It would be useful for researchers with sufficient data to explore the affects of using different density measures. 3. In general, even in harvested populations with highly skewed sex ratios, males are usually able to fertilize all females, though detailed studies document a lower proportion of younger females breeding when sex ratios are heavily female biased. It is well documented that the presence of males can induce oestrus in females, and that male age may also be a factor. In populations with both a skewed sex ratio and a young male age structure, calving is delayed and less synchronous. We identify several mechanisms that may be responsible for this. 4. Delayed calving may lower summer survival and autumn masses, which may lead to higher winter mortality. If females are born light, they may require another year of growth before they start reproducing. Delayed calving can reduce future fertility of the mother. As the proportion of calves predated during the first few weeks of life is often very high, calving synchrony may also be an important strategy to lower predation rates. 5. We argue that the effects of males on population dynamics of ungulates are likely to be non-trivial, and that their potential effects should not be ignored. The mechanisms we discuss may be important-though much more research is required before we can demonstrate they are.},

Concurrent long-term studies on the dynamics of the same two interacting species in different locations are very rare. This result has led to the tacit assumption that diffehjkrent cases of the same two-species interaction would involve essentially quantitative differences (e.g., context-specific differences in the numeric values of demographic parameters like fecundity or death rates). Here, we show that for one of the best-known two-species systems (ragwort and cinnabar moth), this finding does not hold. The interaction between the plant and its herbivore is fundamentally different in coastal dunes in The Netherlands and in grasslands in Southeast England. In the first case, the dynamics are cyclic and the interaction involves both direct and delayed density dependence; in the second case, the insect has little impact on plant dynamics and there are no time lags in density dependence. The difference is caused by differences in the importance of seed-limitation in plant recruitment in the two locations.},

   abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment , often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equi-librial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution , which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

By contrast, a simple model of budmoth-parasitoid interaction accounts for 90% of the variance in budmoth population growth rates.

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

Although the demographic effects of time lags have been incorporated into analyses of time series data, there are few detailed descriptions of the long-term demographic consequences of a change in density. We use detailed, individual-based data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the North Block of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to describe long-term demographic and spatial effects of a change in density. The population was released from hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density doubled and, since the early 1980s, has fluctuated around ecological carrying capacity. The cessation of culling led to long-term transient spatial and demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age-and sex-specific vital rates on annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing, 30 years after cessation of the cull, suggesting that a change in density may generate transient dynamics that persist for several generations.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator– prey interaction [Abrams, P. & Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. & Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr & Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.},

This paper presents a new method for such purposes by using a multi-layer neural network with residual minimization training, where an object function composed of a sum of squared residuals of supposed governing equations at collocation points and squared deviations of the solutions from observation data is minimized. Firstly, we applied this method to analysis of "model observation data" produced by numerical integration of equations of a predator-prey system. As a result the parameters included in the model equations are recovered with considerably high accuracy even when artificial random noises are added to the original solutions. Then, we applied it successfully to real time-series data of protozoan populations. It is concluded that the new method can be effectively applied to analyses of time-series data in the field of the ecological science. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population dynamics. Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate substantially, declines in aphid population growth rates do not coincide with increases in parasitism. Therefore, parasitism cannot be responsible for the density-dependent regulation of aphid populations observed in the field. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Our knowledge about population-level effects of abiotic stressors is limited, largely due to lack of appropriate time-series data. To analyse interactions between an abiotic stressor and density-dependent processes, we used experimental time-series data for stage-structured populations (the blowfly Lucilia sericata) exposed to the toxicant cadmium through 20 generations. Resource limitation results in competition both in the larval and the adult stages. The toxicant has only negative effects at the organism level, but nevertheless, there were positive population-level effects. These are necessarily indirect, and indicate overcompensatory density-dependent responses. A non-parametric model (generalized additive model) was used to investigate the density-dependent structures of the demographic rates, without making assumptions about the functional forms. The estimated structures were used to develop a parametric model, with which we analysed effects of the toxicant on density-dependent and density-independent components of the stage-specific demographic rates. The parameter estimates identified both synergistic and antagonistic density-toxicant interactions. It is noteworthy that the synergistic interaction occurred together with a net positive effect of the toxicant. Hence, the effects of such interactions should be considered together with the capacity for compensatory responses. The combination of the two modelling approaches provided new insight into mechanisms for compensatory responses to abiotic stressors. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids); and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long-term population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

It uses time-series data to calculate average rates of change in a large number of populations of terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrate species. The dataset contains about 3000 population time series for over 1100 species. Two methods of calculating the index are outlined: the chain method and a method based on linear modelling of log-transformed data. The dataset is analysed to compare the relative representation of biogeographic realms, ecoregional biomes, threat status and taxonomic groups among species contributing to the index. The two methods show very similar results: terrestrial species declined on average by 25% from 1970 to 2000. Birds and mammals are over-represented in comparison with other vertebrate classes, and temperate species are over-represented compared with tropical species, but there is little difference in representation between threatened and non-threatened species. Some of the problems arising from over-representation are reduced by the way in which the index is calculated. It may be possible to reduce this further by post-stratification and weighting, but new information would first need to be collected for data-poor classes, realms and biomes. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Population dynamic modelling often entails parameterizing quite sophisticated biological and ecological mechanisms. For models of moderate mechanistic complexity, this has traditionally been done in an ad hoc manner, with different parameters being estimated independently. The point estimates so obtained are then used for model simulation, perhaps with some further ad hoc adjustment based on comparison with any available data on population dynamics. Quantitative assessments of model adequacy and prediction uncertainty are not easily made using this approach. As an alternative, the paper investigates the practical feasibility of fitting a moderately complex population dynamic model directly and simultaneously to all the data available for parameterization of the model, and to all available data on the population dynamics of the target animal. This alternative approach allows us to combine all available quantitative information on the target species, to assess the viability of the model, the mutual consistency of model and different sources of data and to estimate the uncertainties that are associated with model-based predictions. The target organism in this study is the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex (L.), which we model using a stage-structured population dynamic model, implemented via a set of delay differential equations describing the basic demography of the population. Target data include population dynamic data from two sites, information on basic physiological relationships and environmental temperature data. Fitting is performed by using a non-linear least squares approach supplemented with a bootstrapping method for avoiding small scale local minima in the least squares objective function. Variance estimation is performed by further bootstrapping. Interest in Gammarus pulex population dynamics in this case is primarily related to likely population level responses to chemical stressors, and for this we examine predicted 'recovery times' following exposure to a known toxicant. © 2006 Royal Statistical Society.},

Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging, based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198 species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support for density dependence ¼ 74.7-92.2%), and that this holds across widely different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among species but increased consistently with the number of generations monitored. Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9% of species time series), while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less frequently (32.6-49.8%). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population dynamical behaviors.},

However, it is usually hard to do for most of the ecological and environmental problems, because of the lack of a consistent theoretical background. Neural networks are universal and flexible models for linear and non-linear systems. This paper aimed to modeling an ecosystem using neural network models and the conventional model, and assessing their effectiveness in the dynamic simulation of ecosystem. Elman neural network model, linear neural network model, and linear ordinary differential equation were developed to simulate the dynamics of Chinese cabbage growth system recorded in the field. Matlab codes for these neural network models were given. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to detect the robustness of these models. The results showed that Elman neural network model could simulate the multivariate non-linear system at the desired accuracy. Linear neural network model may simulate such a non-linear system only in certain conditions. Conventional linear ordinary differential equation yielded divergent outputs in the dynamic simulation of the multivariate non-linear system. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the learning rate influenced the simulation performance of linear neural network model. Transfer function of the second layer in Elman neural network model would influence the simulation performance of this model, but little influence was produced when other functions were changed. Elman neural network was proven to be a robust model. Sensitivity analysis showed that the different choices of functions and parameters in neural network model would influence the performance of simulation. Sensitivity analysis is therefore powerful to detect the robustness and stability of neural network models. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Trophic relationships, such as those between predator and prey or between pathogen and host, are key interactions linking species in ecological food webs. The structure of these links and their strengths have major consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations, in rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats, show that the predator or pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly linked in these experimental microcosms, but without this knowledge, we would infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring defense against attack, and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the phage-bacteria experiments, where bacterial evolution could be tracked. Modeling suggests that rapid evolution may also confound experimental approaches to measuring interaction strength, but it identifies certain experimental designs as being more robust against potential confounding by rapid evolution. © 2007 Yoshida et al.},

   abstract = {Enhancing the predictive power of models in biology is a challenging issue. Among the major difficulties impeding model development and implementation are the sensitivity of outcomes to variations in model parameters, the problem of choosing of particular expressions for the parametrization of functional relations, and difficulties in validating models using laboratory data and/or field observations. In this paper, we revisit the phenomenon which is referred to as structural sensitivity of a model. Structural sensitivity arises as a result of the interplay between sensitivity of model outcomes to variations in parameters and sensitivity to the choice of model functions, and this can be somewhat of a bottleneck in improving the models predictive power. We provide a rigorous definition of structural sensitivity and we show how we can quantify the degree of sensitivity of a model based on the Hausdorff distance concept. We propose a simple semi-analytical test of structural sensitivity in an ODE modeling framework. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of directly linking the variability of field/experimental data and model predictions, and we demonstrate a way of assessing the robustness of modeling predictions with respect to data sampling variability. As an insightful illustrative example, we test our sensitivity analysis methods on a chemostat predator-prey model, where we use laboratory data on the feeding of protozoa to parameterize the predator functional response. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Directionality in coupling, defined as the linkage relating causes to their effects at a later time, can be used to explain the core dynamics of ecological systems by untangling direct and feedback relationships between the different components of the systems. Inferring causality from measured ecological variables sampled through time remains a formidable challenge further made difficult by the action of periodic drivers overlapping the natural dynamics of the system. Periodicity in the drivers can often mask the self-sustained oscillations originating from the autonomous dynamics. While linear and direct causal relationships are commonly addressed in the time domain, using the well-established machinery of Granger causality (G-causality), the presence of periodic forcing requires frequencybased statistics (e.g., the Fourier transform), able to distinguish coupling induced by oscillations in external drivers from genuine endogenous interactions. Recent nonparametric spectral extensions of G-causality to the frequency domain pave the way for the scale-byscale decomposition of causality, which can improve our ability to link oscillatory behaviors of ecological networks to causal mechanisms. The performance of both spectral G-causality and its conditional extension for multivariate systems is explored in quantifying causal interactions within ecological networks. Through two case studies involving synthetic and actual time series, it is demonstrated that conditional G-causality outperforms standard G-causality in identifying causal links and their concomitant timescales. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.},

   abstract = {It is well recognized that models in the life sciences can be sensitive to small variations in their model functions, a phenomenon known as 'structural sensitivity'. Conventionally, modelers test for sensitivity by varying parameters for a specific formulation of the model functions, but models can show structural sensitivity to the choice of functional representations used: a particularly concerning problem when system processes are too complex, or insufficiently understood, to theoretically justify specific parameterizations. Here we propose a rigorous test for the detection of structural sensitivity in a system with respect to the local stability of equilibria, the main idea being to project infinite dimensional function space onto a finite dimensional space by considering the local properties of the model functions. As an illustrative example, we use our test to demonstrate structural sensitivity in the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and show that the conventional parameterbased approach can fail to do so. We also consider some implications that structural sensitivity has for ecological modelling: we argue that when the model exhibits structural sensitivity but experimental results remain consistent it may indicate that there is a problem with the model construction, and that in some cases trying to find an 'optimal' parameterization of a model function may simply be impossible when the model exhibits structural sensitivity. Finally, we suggest that the phenomenon of structural sensitivity in biological models may help explain the irregular oscillations often observed in real ecosystems. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Understanding how the microbiota confers resistance against enteric pathogens and how antibiotics disrupt that resistance is key to the prevention and cure of intestinal infections. We present a novel method to infer microbial community ecology directly from time-resolved metagenomics. This method extends generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics to account for external perturbations. Data from recent experiments on antibiotic-mediated Clostridium difficile infection is analyzed to quantify microbial interactions, commensal-pathogen interactions, and the effect of the antibiotic on the community. Stability analysis reveals that the microbiota is intrinsically stable, explaining how antibiotic perturbations and C. difficile inoculation can produce catastrophic shifts that persist even after removal of the perturbations. Importantly, the analysis suggests a subnetwork of bacterial groups implicated in protection against C. difficile. Due to its generality, our method can be applied to any high-resolution ecological time-series data to infer community structure and response to external stimuli. © 2013 Stein et al.},

A smooth estimate of the solution ODE is built to provide an approximation of the derivative of the ODE solution which is in turn used to learn the nonparametric ODE model.

To achieve this, emergence, structural realism, and prediction have to become key elements of designing models. In the special issue "Next-generation ecological modelling", which is dedicated to Donald DeAngelis on the occasion of his 70th birthday, 16 contributions present and discuss main features of next-generation ecological modelling. One key feature is to base the description of individuals' behaviour and interactions on first principles rooted in energetic or evolutionary theory. To cope with increasing model complexity, standardization, separate testing of alternative submodels against multiple output patterns, and documenting these tests will be required. Including micro-evolution is essential to capture organisms' response to changing conditions. Functional types may be used instead of species for representing communities. Model analysis will be challenging, but robustness analysis, which tries to break models' explanations, can help to tell signals from noise and identify general mechanisms underlying the internal organization of ecological systems. Ultimately, next-generation modelling should aim at developing general theory to better understand stability properties and mechanisms. This understanding then can provide the basis for restoring, maintaining, or strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and supporting sustainable management of natural resources.},

We show that employing sparse representations provides more accurate ODE reconstruction compared to least-squares reconstruction techniques for a given amount of time series data. We test and validate the ODE reconstruction method on known 1D, 2D, and 3D systems of ODEs. The 1D system possesses two stable fixed points; the 2D system possesses an oscillatory fixed point with closed orbits; and the 3D system displays chaotic dynamics on a strange attractor. We determine the amount of data required to achieve an error in the reconstructed functions to less than $0.1\%$. For the reconstructed 1D and 2D systems, we are able to match the trajectories from the original ODEs even at long times. For the 3D system with chaotic dynamics, as expected, the trajectories from the original and reconstructed systems do not match at long times, but the reconstructed and original models possess similar Lyapunov exponents. Now that we have validated this ODE reconstruction method on known models, it can be employed in future studies to identify new systems of ODEs using time series data from deterministic systems for which there is no currently known ODE model.},

   abstract = {Mathematical models in biology are highly simplified representations of a complex underlying reality and there is always a high degree of uncertainty with regards to model function specification. This uncertainty becomes critical for models in which the use of different functions fitting the same dataset can yield substantially different predictions-a property known as structural sensitivity. Thus, even if the model is purely deterministic, then the uncertainty in the model functions carries through into uncertainty in model predictions, and new frameworks are required to tackle this fundamental problem. Here, we consider a framework that uses partially specified models in which some functions are not represented by a specific form. The main idea is to project infinite dimensional function space into a low-dimensional space taking into account biological constraints. The key question of how to carry out this projection has so far remained a serious mathematical challenge and hindered the use of partially specified models. Here, we propose and demonstrate a potentially powerful technique to perform such a projection by using optimal control theory to construct functions with the specified global properties. This approach opens up the prospect of a flexible and easy to use method to fulfil uncertainty analysis of biological models.},

   abstract = {Evaluating the effects of climate variation on ecosystems is of paramount importance for our ability to forecast and mitigate the consequences of global change. However, the ways in which complex food webs respond to climate variations remain poorly understood. Here, we use long-term time series to investigate the effects of temperature variation on the intraguild-predation (IGP) system of Windermere (UK), a lake where pike (Esox lucius, top predator) feed on small-sized perch (Perca fluviatilis) but compete with large-sized perch for the same food sources. Spectral analyses of time series reveal that pike recruitment dynamics are temperature controlled. In 1976, expansion of a size-truncating perch pathogen into the lake severely impacted large perch and favoured pike as the IGP-dominant species. This pathogen-induced regime shift to a pike-dominated IGP apparently triggered a temperature-controlled trophic cascade passing through pike down to dissolved nutrients. In simple food chains, warming is predicted to strengthen top–down control by accelerating metabolic rates in ectothermic consumers, while pathogens of top consumers are predicted to dampen this top–down control. In contrast, the local IGP structure in Windermere made warming and pathogens synergistic in their top–down effects on ecosystem functioning. More generally, our results point to top predators as major mediators of community response to global change, and show that size-selective agents (e.g. pathogens, fishers or hunters) may change the topological architecture of food webs and alter whole ecosystem sensitivity to climate variation.},

   abstract = {Global change is heating up ecosystems fuelling biodiversity loss and species extinctions. High-trophic-level predators are especially prone to extinction due to an energetic mismatch between increasing feeding rates and metabolism with warming. Different adaptation mechanisms such as decreasing body size to reduce energy requirements (morphological response) as well as direct effects of adaptation to feeding parameters (physiological response) have been proposed to overcome this problem. Here, we use protist-bacteria microcosm experiments to show how those adaptations may have the potential to buffer the impact of warming on predator-prey interactions. After adapting the ciliate predator Tetrahymena pyriformis to three different temperatures (15C, 20C and 25C) for approximately 20 generations we conducted functional response experiments on bacterial prey along an experimental temperature gradient (15C, 20C and 25C). We found an increase of maximum feeding rates and half-saturation densities with rising experimental temperatures. Adaptation temperature had on average slightly negative effects on maximum feeding rates, but maximum feeding rates increased more strongly with rising experimental temperature in warm adapted predators than in cold-adapted predators. There was no effect of adaptation temperature on half-saturation densities characterising foraging efficiency. Besides the mixed response in functional response parameters, predators also adapted by decreasing body size. As smaller predators need less energy to fulfill their energetic demands, maximum feeding rates relative to the energetic demands increased slightly with increased adaptation temperature. Accordingly, predators adapted to 25C showed the highest feeding rates at 25C experimental temperature, while predators adapted to 15C showed the highest maximum feeding rate at 15C. Therefore, adaptation to different temperatures potentially avoids an energetic mismatch with warming. Especially a shift in body size with warming additionally to an adaptation of physiological parameters potentially helps to maintain a positive energy balance and prevent predator extinction with rising temperatures.},

   abstract = {The Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare pelt data by the Hudson's Bay Company do not fit the classical predator-prey theory. Rather than following the peak density of the hares, the peak density of the lynx leads it, creating the hares-eat-lynx (HEL) paradox. Although trappers were suspected to be a cause, no mathematical models in the literature have demon-strated the HEL effect. In this paper we consider various multitrophic models with interactions in vegetation-hare-lynx, hare-lynx-coyote, hare-lynx-trapper, and hare-lynx-coyote-trapper, and use Newton's gradient search method to best fit each model to the data and then select the one with the least error as the benchmark model for the data. We will conclude from the bench-mark model and its sensitivity analysis the following: (a) the trappers as a participant rather than an observer of the system changed the observed; (b) the lynx and hare populations in the wild follow the lynx-eats-hares (LEH) cycle but the harvested animals follow the HEL cycle; (c) the benchmark fit is more sensitive to changes in all lynx-trapper interactions than the respective hare-trapper interactions; (d) trappers did not interfere each other's trapping activities a cen-tury ago; (e) the Hudson's Bay Company's hare pelt number was severely fewer than it should be. These results together dispel a long-held hypothesis that the pelt data is a proxy of the hare and lynx populations in the wild. It also shows that theoretical ecology must move beyond the classical Lotka-Volterra paradigm into a contemporary framework in which Holling's predation theory is central to population modeling. It also demonstrates to the ecologists that we do not have to collect data from all dimensions in order to gain a good understanding of complex systems, but instead we can systematically fit models to empirical data of any dimensions with identifiable uncertainties and a complete understanding of parameter sensitivities to the best fit.

Ensembling NNs provides an easily implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.},

   abstract = {The feeding functional response is one of the most widespread mathematical frameworks in ecology, marine biology, freshwater biology, microbiology, and related scientific fields describing the resource-dependent uptake of a consumer. Since the exact knowledge of its parameters is crucial to predict, for example, the efficiency of biocontrol agents, population dynamics, food web structure, and subsequently biodiversity, a trustworthy parameter estimation method is highly important for scientists using this framework. Classical approaches for estimating functional response parameters lack flexibility and often only provide approximations of the correct parameters. Here, we combined ordinary differential equation (ODE) models that were numerically solved using computer simulations with an iterative maximum likelihood fitting approach. We compared our method to classical approaches of fitting functional responses using data both with and without additional resource growth and mortality. We found that for classical functional response models, such as the frequently used type II and type III functional responses, the established fitting methods are reliable. However, by using more complex and flexible functional responses, our new method outperforms the traditional methods. Additionally, our method allows the incorporation of side effects such as resource growth and background mortality. Our method will enable researchers from different scientific fields who are measuring functional responses to calculate more accurate parameter estimates. These estimates will enable community ecologists to parameterize their models more precisely, thus allowing a deeper understanding of complex ecological systems, and will increase the quality of ecological prediction models.},

Yet, measuring the structural stability of nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenging task. Focusing on the classic Lotka-Volterra dynamics, because of the linearity of the functional response, it has been possible to measure the conditions compatible with a structurally stable system. However, the functional response of biological communities is not always well approximated by deterministic linear functions. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which this linear approach can be generalized to other population dynamics models. Here, we show that the same approach used to investigate the classic Lotka-Volterra dynamics, which is called the structural approach, can be applied to a much larger class of nonlinear models. This class covers a large number of nonlinear functional responses that have been intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. We also investigate the applicability of the structural approach to stochastic dynamical systems and we provide a measure of structural stability for finite populations. Overall, we show that the structural approach can provide reliable and tractable information about the qualitative behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems.},

   abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that large-scale patterns such as community stability can be influenced by changes in interspecific interactions that arise from the behavioural and/or physiological responses of individual species varying over time. Although this theory has experimental support, evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking owing to the challenges of tracking rapid changes in interspecific interactions (known to occur on timescales much shorter than a generation time) and then identifying the effect of such changes on large-scale community dynamics. Here, using tools for analysing nonlinear time series and a 12-year-long dataset of fortnightly collected observations on a natural marine fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, we show that short-term changes in interaction networks influence overall community dynamics. Among the 15 dominant species, we identify 14 interspecific interactions to construct a dynamic interaction network. We show that the strengths, and even types, of interactions change with time; we also develop a time-varying stability measure based on local Lyapunov stability for attractor dynamics in non-equilibrium nonlinear systems. We use this dynamic stability measure to examine the link between the time-varying interaction network and community stability. We find seasonal patterns in dynamic stability for this fish community that broadly support expectations of current ecological theory. Specifically, the dominance of weak interactions and higher species diversity during summer months are associated with higher dynamic stability and smaller population fluctuations. We suggest that interspecific interactions, community network structure and community stability are dynamic properties, and that linking fluctuating interaction networks to community-level dynamic properties is key to understanding the maintenance of ecological communities in nature.},

Yet, quantifying the effects of biotic interactions has been challenging due to a lack of appropriate methods to extract accurate measurements of interaction parameters from experimental data. One of the main limitations of existing methods is that the parameters inferred from noisy, sparsely sampled, nonlinear data are seldom uniquely identifiable. That is, many different parameters can be compatible with the same dataset and can generalize to independent data equally well. Hence, it is difficult to justify conclusive assertions about the effect of biotic interactions without information about their associated uncertainty. Here, we develop an ensemble method based on model averaging to quantify the uncertainty associated with the effect of biotic interactions on community dynamics from non-equilibrium ecological time-series data. Our method is able to detect the most informative time intervals for each biotic interaction within a multivariate time series and can be easily adapted to different regression schemes. Overall, this novel approach can be used to associate a time-dependent uncertainty with the effect of biotic interactions. Moreover, because we quantify uncertainty with minimal assumptions about the data-generating process, our approach can be applied to any data for which interactions among variables strongly affect the overall dynamics of the system.},

Pigmentary colors are thought to be strongly involved in sexual selection, while structural colors are thought to generally associate with conspecifics interactions and improve the discrimination of pigmentary colors. Yet, it remains unclear whether age dependency in each color component is consistent with their potential function. Here, we address lifelong ontogenetic variation in three color components (i.e. UV, pigmentary, and skin background colors) in a birth cohort of common lizards Zootoca vivipara across three ventral body regions (i.e. throat, chest, and belly). All three color components developed sexual dichromatism, with males displaying stronger pigmentary and UV colors but weaker skin background coloration than females. The development of color components led to a stronger sexual dichromatism on the concealed ventral region than on the throat. No consistent signs of late-life decay in color components were found except for a deceleration of UV reflectance increase with age on the throat of males. These results suggest that body color components in common lizards are primarily nonsenescent sexual signals, but that the balance between natural and sexual selection may be altered by the conspicuousness of the area of display. These results further support the view that skin coloration is a composite trait constituted of multiple color components conveying multiple signals depending on age, sex, and body location.},

   abstract = {Abstract The field of eco-evolutionary dynamics is developing rapidly, with a growing number of well-designed experiments quantifying the impact of evolution on ecological processes and patterns, ranging from population demography to community composition and ecosystem functioning. The key challenge remains to transfer the insights of these proof-of-principle experiments to natural settings, where multiple species interact and the dynamics are far more complex than those studied in most experiments. Here, we discuss potential pitfalls of building a framework on eco-evolutionary dynamics that is based on data on single species studied in isolation from interspecific interactions, which can lead to both under- and overestimation of the impact of evolution on ecological processes. Underestimation of evolution-driven ecological changes could occur in a single-species approach when the focal species is involved in co-evolutionary dynamics, whereas overestimation might occur due to increased rates of evolution following ecological release of the focal species. In order to develop a multi-species perspective on eco-evolutionary dynamics, we discuss the need for a broad-sense definition of ?eco-evolutionary feedbacks? that includes any reciprocal interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes, next to a narrow-sense definition that refers to interactions that directly feed back on the interactor that evolves. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of using more natural settings in eco-evolutionary studies by gradually adding complexity: (a) multiple interacting species within a guild, (b) food web interactions and (c) evolving metacommunities in multiple habitat patches in a landscape. A literature survey indicated that only a few studies on microbial systems so far developed a truly multi-species approach in their analysis of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and mostly so in artificially constructed communities. Finally, we provide a road map of methods to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in more natural settings. Eco-evolutionary studies involving multiple species are necessarily demanding and might require intensive collaboration among research teams, but are highly needed.

Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. 3. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. 4. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. 5. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.

   abstract = {Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.},

   abstract = {It is well known that fluctuations of species abundances observed in ecological time series emerge from an interplay between deterministic nonlinear dynamics and stochastic forces. Importantly, nonlinearity and stochasticity introduce significant challenges to the analysis of ecological time series, such as the inference of the effect of species interactions on community dynamics and forecasting of species abundances. Local linear fits with state-space-dependent kernel functions, known as S-maps, provide an efficient method to infer Jacobian coefficients (a proxy for the local effect of species interactions) and to make reliable forecasts from nonlinear time series. Yet, while it has been shown that the S-map outperforms existing methods for nonparametric inference and forecasting, the methodology is sensitive to process noise. To overcome this limitation, we integrate the S-map with different regularization schemes. To validate our approach, we test our methodology against different levels of noise and nonlinearity using three standard population dynamics models. We show that an appropriate choice of the regularization scheme, alongside an accurate choice of the kernel functions, can significantly improve the in-sample inference of Jacobian coefficients and the out-of-sample forecast of species abundances in the presence of process noise. We further validate our methodology using two empirical time series of marine microbial communities. Our results illustrate that the regularized S-map is an efficient method for nonparametric inference and forecasting from noisy, nonlinear, ecological time series. Yet, attention must be paid on the regularization scheme and the structure of the kernel for whether inference or forecasting is the ultimate goal of a research study.},

   abstract = {Environmental factors are important drivers of community dynamics. Yet, despite extensive research, it is still extremely challenging to predict the effect of environmental changes on the dynamics of ecological communities. Equilibrium- and model-based approaches have provided a theoretical framework with which to investigate this problem systematically. However, the applicability of this framework to empirical data has been limited because equilibrium dynamics of populations within communities are seldom observed in nature and exact equations for community dynamics are rarely known. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a data-driven non-parametric framework to estimate the tolerance of non-equilibrium community dynamics to environmental perturbations (that is, their structural stability). Following our approach, we show that in non-equilibrium systems, structural stability can vary significantly across time. As a case study, we investigate the structural stability of a rocky intertidal community with dynamics at the edge of chaos. The structural stability of the community as a whole exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, despite the persistent chaotic dynamics of individual populations. Importantly, we show that this seasonal pattern of structural stability is causally driven by sea temperature. Overall, our approach provides novel opportunities for estimating the tolerance of ecological communities to environmental changes within a non-parametric framework.},

The advantages of being able to use the entire DifferentialEquations.jl suite for this purpose is demonstrated by counter examples where simple integration strategies fail, but the sophisticated integration strategies provided by the DifferentialEquations.jl library succeed.

We conclude by discussing the various adjoint methods used for backpropogation of the differential equation solvers.

   abstract = {Short-term forecasts of nonlinear dynamics are important for risk-assessment studies and to inform sustainable decision-making for physical, biological and financial problems, among others. Generally, the accuracy of short-term forecasts depends upon two main factors: the capacity of learning algorithms to generalize well on unseen data and the intrinsic predictability of the dynamics. While generalization skills of learning algorithms can be assessed with well-established methods, estimating the predictability of the underlying nonlinear generating process from empirical time series remains a big challenge. Here, we show that, in changing environments, the predictability of nonlinear dynamics can be associated with the time-varying stability of the system with respect to smooth changes in model parameters, i.e. its local structural stability. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that forecasts from locally structurally unstable states in smoothly changing environments can produce significantly large prediction errors, and we provide a systematic methodology to identify these states from data. Finally, we illustrate the practical applicability of our results using an empirical dataset. Overall, this study provides a framework to associate an uncertainty level with short-term forecasts made in smoothly changing environments.},

To avoid this, managers and ecologists seek accurate predictions of the ecosystem-wide impacts of interventions, given small and imprecise datasets, which is an incredibly difficult task. We generated and analysed thousands of ecosystem population time series to investigate whether fitted models can aid decision-makers to select interventions. Using these time-series data (sparse and noisy datasets drawn from deterministic Lotka-Volterra systems with two to nine species, of known network structure), dynamic model forecasts of whether a species’ future population will be positively or negatively affected by rapid eradication of another species were correct > 70% of the time. Although 70% correct classifications is only slightly better than an uninformative prediction (50%), this classification accuracy can be feasibly improved by increasing monitoring accuracy and frequency. Our findings suggest that models may not need to produce well-constrained predictions before they can inform decisions that improve environmental outcomes.},

This complexity arising from the evidence of context-dependencies has underscored a difficulty in establishing a systematic analysis about the extent to which species interactions are expected to switch in nature and experiments. Here, we propose an overarching theoretical framework, by integrating probabilistic and structural approaches, to establish null expectations about switches of interaction classes across environmental contexts.

   abstract = {Summary 1. Predicting competitive outcomes in communities frequently involves inferences based on deterministic population models since these provide clear criteria for exclusion (e.g., R* rule) or long-term coexistence (e.g., mutual invasibility). 2. However, incorporating stochasticity into population- or community-level processes into models is necessary if the goal is to explain variation in natural systems, which are inherently stochastic. 3. Similarly, in systems with demographic or environmental stochasticity, weaker competitors have the potential to exclude superior competitors, contributing to what is known as ’competitive indeterminancy’. The importance of such effects for natural communities is unknown, in part because it is difficult to demonstrate that multiple forms of stochasticity are present in these communities. Moreover, the effects of multiple forms of stochasticity on competitive outcomes are largely untested, even in theory. 4. Here, we address these issues by examining the role of stochasticity in replicated communities of flour beetles (Tribolium sp.). To do so, we developed a set of two-species stochastic Ricker models incorporating four distinct forms of stochasticity: environmental stochasticity, demographic stochasticity, demographic heterogeneity, and stochastic sex determination. 5. By fitting models to experimental data, and simulating fit models to examine long term behavior, we found that both the duration of tranisent coexistence and the degree of competitive indeterminacy were sensitive to the forms of stochasticity included in our models. These findings suggest current estimates of extinction risk, coexistence, and time until competitive exclusion in communities may not be accurate when based on models that exclude relevant forms of stochasticity.},

While many deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the state space. Our algorithm-distributional gradient matching (DGM)-jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our approach is faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen trajectories, and in the context of neural ODEs, significantly more accurate.},

   abstract = {Identifying directed interactions between species from time series of their population densities has many uses in ecology. This key statistical task is equivalent to causal time series inference, which connects to the Granger causality (GC) concept: x causes y if x improves the prediction of y in a dynamic model. However, the entangled nature of nonlinear ecological systems has led to question the appropriateness of Granger causality, especially in its classical linear multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model form. Convergent cross mapping (CCM), a nonparametric method developed for deterministic dynamical systems, has been suggested as an alternative. Here, we show that linear GC and CCM are able to uncover interactions with surprisingly similar performance, for predator-prey cycles, 2-species deterministic (chaotic), or stochastic competition, as well as 10- and 20-species interaction networks. We found no correspondence between the degree of nonlinearity of the dynamics and which method performs best. Our results therefore imply that Granger causality, even in its linear MAR(p) formulation, is a valid method for inferring interactions in nonlinear ecological networks; using GC or CCM (or both) can instead be decided based on the aims and specifics of the analysis.},

   abstract = {A central theme in ecological research is to understand how species interactions contribute to community dynamics. Species interactions are the basis of parametric (model-driven) and nonparametric (model-free) approaches in theoretical and empirical work. However, despite their different interpretations across these approaches, these measures have occasionally been used interchangeably, limiting our opportunity to use their differences to gain new insights about ecological systems. Here, we revisit two of the most used measures across these approaches: species interactions measured as constant direct effects (typically used in parametric approaches) and local aggregated effects (typically used in nonparametric approaches). We show two fundamental properties of species interactions that cannot be revealed without bridging these definitions. First, we show that the local aggregated intraspecific effect summarizes all potential pathways through which one species impacts itself, which are likely to be negative even without any constant direct self-regulation mechanism. This property has implications for the long-held debate on how communities can be stabilized when little evidence of self-regulation has been found among higher-trophic species. Second, we show that a local aggregated interspecific effect between two species is correlated with the constant direct interspecific effect if and only if the population dynamics do not have any higher-order direct effects. This other property provides a rigorous methodology to detect direct higher-order effects in the field and experimental data. Overall, our findings illustrate a practical route to gain further insights about non-equilibrium ecological dynamics and species interactions.},

   abstract = {The assessment of relative model performance using information criteria like AIC and BIC has become routine among functional-response studies, reflecting trends in the broader ecological literature. Such information criteria allow comparison across diverse models because they penalize each model's fit by its parametric complexity—in terms of their number of free parameters—which allows simpler models to outperform similarly fitting models of higher parametric complexity. However, criteria like AIC and BIC do not consider an additional form of model complexity, referred to as geometric complexity, which relates specifically to the mathematical form of the model. Models of equivalent parametric complexity can differ in their geometric complexity and thereby in their ability to flexibly fit data. Here we use the Fisher Information Approximation to compare, explain, and contextualize how geometric complexity varies across a large compilation of single-prey functional-response models—including prey-, ratio-, and predator-dependent formulations—reflecting varying apparent degrees and forms of non-linearity. Because a model's geometric complexity varies with the data's underlying experimental design, we also sought to determine which designs are best at leveling the playing field among functional-response models. Our analyses illustrate (1) the large differences in geometric complexity that exist among functional-response models, (2) there is no experimental design that can minimize these differences across all models, and (3) even the qualitative nature by which some models are more or less flexible than others is reversed by changes in experimental design. Failure to appreciate model flexibility in the empirical evaluation of functional-response models may therefore lead to biased inferences for predator–prey ecology, particularly at low experimental sample sizes where its impact is strongest. We conclude by discussing the statistical and epistemological challenges that model flexibility poses for the study of functional responses as it relates to the attainment of biological truth and predictive ability.},
