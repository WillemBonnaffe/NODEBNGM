# NODEBNGM
 

## Overview

This repository contains code to fit neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to time series data using Bayesian neural gradient matching (BNGM).

The folder examples contains the case studies used for the arXiv and MEE manuscripts, which includes an artificial time series of a three-species prey-predator system, 3 replicated time series of an algae, flagellate, and rotifer system, and the hare-lynx time series.

The folder versions contains the template repository for fitting NODE by BNGM to new time series datasets.

Further instructions on how to run NODEs can be found in these directories.
