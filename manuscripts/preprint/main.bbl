    A method is presented to solve partial differential equations (pde's) and
  its boundary and/or initial conditions by using neural networks. It uses the
  fact that multiple input, single output, single hidden layer feedforward
  networks with a linear output layer with no bias are capable of arbitrarily
  well approximating arbitrary functions and its derivatives, which is proven
  by a number of authors and well known in literature. Knowledge about the pde
  and its boundary and/or initial conditions is incorporated into the
  structures and the training sets of several neural networks. In this way we
  obtain networks of which some are specifically structured. To find the
  solution of the pde and its boundary and/or initial conditions we have to
  train all obtained networks simultaneously. Therefore we use an evolutionary
  algorithm to train the networks. We demonstrate the working of our method by
  applying it to two problems.%

    Well-intentioned environmental management can backfire, causing unforeseen
  damage. To avoid this, managers and ecologists seek accurate predictions of
  the ecosystem-wide impacts of interventions, given small and imprecise
  datasets, which is an incredibly difficult task. We generated and analysed
  thousands of ecosystem population time series to investigate whether fitted
  models can aid decision-makers to select interventions. Using these
  time-series data (sparse and noisy datasets drawn from deterministic
  Lotka-Volterra systems with two to nine species, of known network structure),
  dynamic model forecasts of whether a species’ future population will be
  positively or negatively affected by rapid eradication of another species
  were correct > 70% of the time. Although 70% correct classifications is only
  slightly better than an uninformative prediction (50%), this classification
  accuracy can be feasibly improved by increasing monitoring accuracy and
  frequency. Our findings suggest that models may not need to produce
  well-constrained predictions before they can inform decisions that improve
  environmental outcomes.%

    It is well recognized that models in the life sciences can be sensitive to
  small variations in their model functions, a phenomenon known as 'structural
  sensitivity'. Conventionally, modelers test for sensitivity by varying
  parameters for a specific formulation of the model functions, but models can
  show structural sensitivity to the choice of functional representations used:
  a particularly concerning problem when system processes are too complex, or
  insufficiently understood, to theoretically justify specific
  parameterizations. Here we propose a rigorous test for the detection of
  structural sensitivity in a system with respect to the local stability of
  equilibria, the main idea being to project infinite dimensional function
  space onto a finite dimensional space by considering the local properties of
  the model functions. As an illustrative example, we use our test to
  demonstrate structural sensitivity in the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur
  predator-prey model, and show that the conventional parameterbased approach
  can fail to do so. We also consider some implications that structural
  sensitivity has for ecological modelling: we argue that when the model
  exhibits structural sensitivity but experimental results remain consistent it
  may indicate that there is a problem with the model construction, and that in
  some cases trying to find an 'optimal' parameterization of a model function
  may simply be impossible when the model exhibits structural sensitivity.
  Finally, we suggest that the phenomenon of structural sensitivity in
  biological models may help explain the irregular oscillations often observed
  in real ecosystems. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All

    Recent investigations have shown that processes within the planktonic
  microbial web are of great significance for the functioning of limnetic
  ecosystems. However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as
  food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has
  seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the
  food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic
  flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most
  rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of
  heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have
  indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria
  consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according
  to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient
  predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even
  nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and
  chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively
  low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and
  protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to
  suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it.
  Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant
  feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates,
  small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids)
  seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another
  important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web.
  Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web
  and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary
  for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems.

    can give rise to spurious diagnosis of second-order feedback effects
  (de-layed density dependence). They go on to warn that diagnosis of the
  underlying causes of population dynamics from time-series data is ''at best
  tenuous and may be impossible.'' This pessimistic conclusion is based on
  simulations with a first-order single-species population model (the Ricker
  ''logistic'' equation) in which the exogenous driving variable is strongly
  au-tocorrelated. Analysis of data generated by this model indicates that
  spurious second-order effects can be detected if the autocorrelation in the
  exogenous variable is strong while endogenous feedback is weak. The point
  raised by Williams and Liebhold (1995) is legitimate, and has been discussed
  previously by Royama (1981). However, we argue that Williams and Liebhold
  overstate the importance of this potential problem. Two points need to be
  considered in order to put Williams and Liebhold's argument in its proper
  perspective. 1) The results presented in Table 1 of Williams and Liebhold
  (1995: 1006) give a misleading impression that spurious second-order effects
  occur frequently for most combinations of parameters likely to be encountered
  in analyzing real data. This impression results from their restriction of the
  range of the maximum per capita rate-of-change parameter, r, to values
  between 0.1 and 0.7, where spurious effects are more likely to be observed in
  simulated data. However, the value of r estimated from forest insect and
  small-mammal population data (these are the taxa that most frequently show
  second-order effects) typically exceeds unity. For Manuscript example,
  estimates of the maximum annual per capita rates of change of 19 forest
  insect populations ranged from 0.58 to 4.27 with 90% being 1 (Berryman 1995),
  while the intrinsic rates of change of small-mammal populations were
  estimated to be between 2.7 and 5.4 (Hanski and Korpimaki 1995). (Note that
  estimates of r from multiple-regression models may not accurately reflect the
  maximum value of r, so direct measurements from the time series, as done by
  Berryman [1995] and Hanski and Korpimäki [1995], are preferable.) Williams
  and Liebhold acknowledge that the number of spurious second-order cases
  decreases as r increases. Hence, spurious second-order effects seem less
  likely to be encountered in real data than Williams and Lieb-hold (1995)
  imply. In addition, Williams and Liebhold used simulated time series that are
  longer than those usually encountered in practice (50 yr vs. the 10-30 yr
  typical of ecological data). Having longer time series gives one greater
  power in detecting weak statistical effects. Thus, the proportion of
  significantly spurious second-order effects in Table 1 probably overestimates
  the probability of finding such a spurious result in real applications.
  Finally, spurious second-order effects are primarily observed when
  autocorrelation in the exog-enous variable is strong (i.e., 0.3), which
  brings us to our second point. 2) Williams and Liebhold fail to demonstrate
  why we should frequently find strongly autocorrelated ex-ogenous driving
  variables in ecological systems. By definition, an exogenous variable is one
  that affects the variable of interest (the population) but is unaffected by
  that variable. Williams and Liebhold state that weather is the most likely
  exogenous factor affecting field populations, but then concede that annual
  weather patterns show little (if any) autocorrelation. Because annual weather
  fluctuations are not strongly autocor-related, and as most time-series
  analyses are performed on annual counts, weather would seem to be an unlikely
  candidate for creating spurious second-order effects in ecological
  time-series counts. Williams and Liebhold then suggest that generalist
  predators could act as exogenous factors. However, generalist predators do
  not normally fit the definition of an exogenous variable because they often
  respond behaviorally (and sometimes numerically) to the density of their prey
  (Holling 1965). Behavioral responses of generalist predators to the density
  of their prey, such as increased consumption, switching, and spatial
  ag-gregation, occur on a fast time scale, resulting in powerful first-order
  endogenous feedback on the prey population (Berryman 1981, Berryman et al.
  1987). It is possible, of course, for generalist predators to act
  independently of the density of one prey species. Under%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The understanding of developmental patterns of body coloration is
  challenging because of the multicomponent nature of color signals and the
  multiple selective pressures acting upon them, which further depend on the
  sex of the bearer and area of display. Pigmentary colors are thought to be
  strongly involved in sexual selection, while structural colors are thought to
  generally associate with conspecifics interactions and improve the
  discrimination of pigmentary colors. Yet, it remains unclear whether age
  dependency in each color component is consistent with their potential
  function. Here, we address lifelong ontogenetic variation in three color
  components (i.e. UV, pigmentary, and skin background colors) in a birth
  cohort of common lizards Zootoca vivipara across three ventral body regions
  (i.e. throat, chest, and belly). All three color components developed sexual
  dichromatism, with males displaying stronger pigmentary and UV colors but
  weaker skin background coloration than females. The development of color
  components led to a stronger sexual dichromatism on the concealed ventral
  region than on the throat. No consistent signs of late-life decay in color
  components were found except for a deceleration of UV reflectance increase
  with age on the throat of males. These results suggest that body color
  components in common lizards are primarily nonsenescent sexual signals, but
  that the balance between natural and sexual selection may be altered by the
  conspicuousness of the area of display. These results further support the
  view that skin coloration is a composite trait constituted of multiple color
  components conveying multiple signals depending on age, sex, and body
  location.%

    Long-term studies of two-species interactions under field conditions are
  unusual; most long-term field studies are of single species dynamics (1-6).
  Concurrent long-term studies on the dynamics of the same two interacting
  species in different locations are very rare. This result has led to the
  tacit assumption that diffehjkrent cases of the same two-species interaction
  would involve essentially quantitative differences (e.g., context-specific
  differences in the numeric values of demographic parameters like fecundity or
  death rates). Here, we show that for one of the best-known two-species
  systems (ragwort and cinnabar moth), this finding does not hold. The
  interaction between the plant and its herbivore is fundamentally different in
  coastal dunes in The Netherlands and in grasslands in Southeast England. In
  the first case, the dynamics are cyclic and the interaction involves both
  direct and delayed density dependence; in the second case, the insect has
  little impact on plant dynamics and there are no time lags in density
  dependence. The difference is caused by differences in the importance of
  seed-limitation in plant recruitment in the two locations.%

    Population limitation is a fundamental tenet of ecology, but the relative
  roles of exogenous and endogenous mechanisms remain unquantified for most
  species. Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging,
  based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the
  relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent
  population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198
  species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for
  detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and
  best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or
  cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density
  dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support
  for density dependence ¼ 74.7-92.2%), and that this holds across widely
  different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among
  species but increased consistently with the number of generations monitored.
  Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a
  density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9% of species time series),
  while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less
  frequently (32.6-49.8%). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence
  of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the
  statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using
  multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a
  set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population
  dynamical behaviors.%

    Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics,
  chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the
  ecology of populations, communities, And ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate
  at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is
  the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory
  for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic
  theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake
  from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and
  reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization
  from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history
  attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life
  span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including
  carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of
  species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass
  production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled
  from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions.
  Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of
  ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of
  evolutionary biology.%

    1. Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and
  ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that
  is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which
  vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population
  trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary
  dynamics. 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic
  rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished
  stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and
  uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as
  well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment
  performed in a glasshouse. 3. Using data on changes in population abundance
  and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with
  inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit
  across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific
  caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the
  model on survival, growth and reproduction. 4. Results suggest that clones
  varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction
  and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative
  density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of
  predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while
  survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth
  rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation
  based on the pure clones. 5. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much
  vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition
  analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving
  populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed
  an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss
  that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of
  individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and
  limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach. K E Y W O R D S

    While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the
  solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the
  selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much
  less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation
  procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efficiently in closed
  form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient
  means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of
  performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are
  therefore prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use
  of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a
  replarisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior
  over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation
  parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of
  thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the
  benefit of this approach.%

    Biotic interactions are expected to play a major role in shaping the
  dynamics of ecological systems. Yet, quantifying the effects of biotic
  interactions has been challenging due to a lack of appropriate methods to
  extract accurate measurements of interaction parameters from experimental
  data. One of the main limitations of existing methods is that the parameters
  inferred from noisy, sparsely sampled, nonlinear data are seldom uniquely
  identifiable. That is, many different parameters can be compatible with the
  same dataset and can generalize to independent data equally well. Hence, it
  is difficult to justify conclusive assertions about the effect of biotic
  interactions without information about their associated uncertainty. Here, we
  develop an ensemble method based on model averaging to quantify the
  uncertainty associated with the effect of biotic interactions on community
  dynamics from non-equilibrium ecological time-series data. Our method is able
  to detect the most informative time intervals for each biotic interaction
  within a multivariate time series and can be easily adapted to different
  regression schemes. Overall, this novel approach can be used to associate a
  time-dependent uncertainty with the effect of biotic interactions. Moreover,
  because we quantify uncertainty with minimal assumptions about the
  data-generating process, our approach can be applied to any data for which
  interactions among variables strongly affect the overall dynamics of the
  system.%

    We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of
  specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the
  derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the
  network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These
  continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation
  strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for
  speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks
  and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous
  normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood,
  without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show
  how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its
  internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger
  models.%

    A change in population density can generate spatial and demographic effects
  that can have an impact on fluctuations in population size for many years.
  Although the demographic effects of time lags have been incorporated into
  analyses of time series data, there are few detailed descriptions of the
  long-term demographic consequences of a change in density. We use detailed,
  individual-based data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the
  North Block of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to describe long-term demographic
  and spatial effects of a change in density. The population was released from
  hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density
  doubled and, since the early 1980s, has fluctuated around ecological carrying
  capacity. The cessation of culling led to long-term transient spatial and
  demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates
  responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term
  changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These
  changes altered the impact of different age-and sex-specific vital rates on
  annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing, 30 years
  after cessation of the cull, suggesting that a change in density may generate
  transient dynamics that persist for several generations.%

    Summary 1. Predicting competitive outcomes in communities frequently
  involves inferences based on deterministic population models since these
  provide clear criteria for exclusion (e.g., R* rule) or long-term coexistence
  (e.g., mutual invasibility). 2. However, incorporating stochasticity into
  population- or community-level processes into models is necessary if the goal
  is to explain variation in natural systems, which are inherently stochastic.
  3. Similarly, in systems with demographic or environmental stochasticity,
  weaker competitors have the potential to exclude superior competitors,
  contributing to what is known as ’competitive indeterminancy’. The
  importance of such effects for natural communities is unknown, in part
  because it is difficult to demonstrate that multiple forms of stochasticity
  are present in these communities. Moreover, the effects of multiple forms of
  stochasticity on competitive outcomes are largely untested, even in theory.
  4. Here, we address these issues by examining the role of stochasticity in
  replicated communities of flour beetles (Tribolium sp.). To do so, we
  developed a set of two-species stochastic Ricker models incorporating four
  distinct forms of stochasticity: environmental stochasticity, demographic
  stochasticity, demographic heterogeneity, and stochastic sex determination.
  5. By fitting models to experimental data, and simulating fit models to
  examine long term behavior, we found that both the duration of tranisent
  coexistence and the degree of competitive indeterminacy were sensitive to the
  forms of stochasticity included in our models. These findings suggest current
  estimates of extinction risk, coexistence, and time until competitive
  exclusion in communities may not be accurate when based on models that
  exclude relevant forms of stochasticity.%

    A computational revolution unleashed the power of artiicial neural
  networks. At the heart of that revolution is automatic diierentiation, which
  calculates the derivative of a performance measure relative to a large number
  of parameters. Diierentiation enhances the discovery of improved performance
  in large models, an achievement that was previously diicult or impossible.
  Recently, a second computational advance optimizes the temporal trajectories
  traced by diierential equations. Optimization requires diieren-tiating a
  measure of performance over a trajectory, such as the closeness of tracking
  the environment, with respect to the parameters of the diierential equations.
  Because model trajectories are usually calculated numerically by multistep
  algorithms, such as Runge-Kuua, the automatic diierentiation must be passed
  through the numerical algorithm. .is article explains how such automatic
  diierentiation of trajectories is achieved. It also discusses why such
  computational breakthroughs are likely to advance theoretical and statistical
  studies of biological problems, in which one can consider variables as
  dynamic paths over time and space. Many common problems arise between
  improving success in computational learning models over performance
  landscapes, improving evolutionary ytness over adaptive landscapes, and
  improving statistical lts to data over information landscapes.%

    Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these
  data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates,
  mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information
  from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating
  fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to
  re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved
  vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by
  replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating
  population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates
  change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data
  that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population
  dynamics. Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea
  aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are
  consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this
  regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the
  role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling
  methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid
  dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions
  about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We
  find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate
  substantially, declines in aphid population growth rates do not coincide with
  increases in parasitism. Therefore, parasitism cannot be responsible for the
  density-dependent regulation of aphid populations observed in the field. ©

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important
  phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the
  outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of
  this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
  dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have
  evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the
  overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that
  ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential
  to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution
  be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
  impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a
  framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven
  by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary
  factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental
  change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its
  contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
  other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a
  theoretical predator– prey interaction [Abrams, P. & Matsuda, H. (1997).
  Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey
  evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63% that of internal
  ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these
  contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets
  for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets
  relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as
  character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For
  Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. &
  Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
  has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a
  population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to
  fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr & Dillon, T.A. (1990).
  Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one
  quarter the rate of ecological change – less than in the finch example, but
  nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to
  understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to
  consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation
  are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.%

    \field{note}{- Only if you need an example of dynamics from which to infer
  trophic interactions.<br/><br/>* Notes<br/>- The author adress how intraguild
  predation affects prey-predator cycles.<br/>- They claim that they
  demonstrate dynamics that are in accordance with theory algae -> flagellate
  -> rotifer. But they state that flagellate growth rate is primarily driven by
  rotifers, rather than by algae.<br/>- I can use this paper to justify using a
  three-species trophic network, because it is a fundamental component of
  natural food webs.<br/>- The author state that there are few empirical
  demonstrations of population dynamics for three-species systems. I deduce
  from it that at that point, it was not even possible to assess
  generalisation.<br/>- Flagellates did tend to go extinct, so they pumped them
  artificially at around 4 % pday.<br/>- The authors state that they reported
  only runs with no evidence of prey defense evolution, but that evolution was
  common in their runs.<br/>- Looking at their equations I realised I did not
  consider the possibility for fluctuations in resource availability. This is
  one of the hidden variables. I will need to think about that.<br/>- Overall,
  they state that results are "exactly" as predicted. I would argue that
  qualitatively this is seems correct but quantitatively the story may be
  different.<br/>- They state that the peak of flagellate being so close to the
  algae can be due to a strong dominant drive by the rotifer population, though
  they only hypothesise that. This seems to be the case in other
  microzooplankton systems. Your results confirm this and potentially increase
  the complexity of the interactions.<br/>- They still argue that prey
  evolution played at best a minor role in explaining the dynamics. However,
  they do admit that they did not have direct evidence for supporting constant
  interaction strength. I can see that being useful in your paper which seems
  to point in fact at quite important implications for evolution in explaining
  differences across replicates and preventing generalisation.}

    Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying
  environment , often making it difficult to measure the stability of
  communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point.
  Instead of an equilibrium point, the equi-librial state of communities
  subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution , which
  is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we
  derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure
  different characteristics associated with community stability. These
  properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using
  first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how
  to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals
  for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the
  problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To
  illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic
  communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish
  abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical
  methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions
  between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical
  properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be
  used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.%

    The interpretation of ecological data has been greatly improved by bridging
  the gap between ecological and statistical models. The major challenge is to
  separate competing hypotheses concerning demography, or other ecological
  relationships, and environmental variability (noise). In this paper we
  demonstrate that this may be an arduous, if not impossible, task. It is the
  lack of adequate ecological theory, rather than statistical sophistication,
  which leads to this problem. A reconstruction of underlying ecological
  processes can only be done if we are certain of either the demographic or the
  noise model, which is something that can only be achieved by an improved
  theory of stochastic ecological processes. Ignoring the fact that this is a
  real problem may mislead ecologists and result in erroneous conclusions about
  the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous factors in natural
  ecosystems. The lack of correct model identification may also have
  far-reaching consequences for population management and conservation.%

    The functional response is a key element in all predator-prey interactions.
  Although functional responses are traditionally modelled as being a function
  of prey density only, evidence is accumulating that predator density also has
  an important effect. However, much of the evidence comes from artificial
  experimental arenas under conditions not necessarily representative of the
  natural system, and neglecting the temporal dynamics of the organism (in
  particular the effects of prey depletion on the estimated functional
  response). Here we present a method that removes these limitations by
  reconstructing the functional response non-parametrically from predator-prey
  time-series data. This method is applied to data on a protozoan predator-prey
  interaction, and we obtain significant evidence of predator dependence in the
  functional response. A crucial element in this analysis is to include
  time-lags in the prey and predator reproduction rates, and we show that these
  delays improve the fit of the model significantly. Finally, we compare the
  non-parametrically reconstructed functional response to parametric forms, and
  suggest that a modified version of the Hassell-Varley predator interference
  model provides a simple and flexible function for theoretical investigation
  and applied modelling.%

  theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are
  capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time,
  statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time
  series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both
  disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding
  can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly
  independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to
  apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both
  long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and
  experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify
  hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and
  forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand,
  as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics. We
  finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters , both
  from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series
  data using modern statistical techniques. Finally, we compare simulated time
  series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety
  of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as ''probes.'' The
  model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to
  be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the
  population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of
  Nich-olson's blowfly populations, in which we know the ''true'' governing
  mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information
  available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that
  this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as
  well.%

    The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic
  example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for populations that
  exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological
  mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but
  despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite
  conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three
  hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality
  (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids
  (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids); and (3) maternal effects
  (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the
  empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis
  in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting
  approach to fit each model to three long-term population time series in
  Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric
  bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their
  goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at
  Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at
  Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and
  at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism
  models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1
  during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have
  been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the
  observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of
  empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though
  allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any
  location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The
  maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the
  constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at
  two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the
  remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal
  effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong
  biological and dynamical evidence. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of

    For populations with a density-dependent life history reproducing at
  discrete annual intervals, we analyze small or moderate fluctuations in
  population size around a stable equilibrium, which is applicable to many
  vertebrate populations. Using a life history having age at maturity a, with
  stochasticity and density dependence in adult recruitment and mortality, we
  derive a linearized autoregressive equation with time lags from 1 to a yr.
  Contrary to current interpretations, the coefficients corresponding to
  different time lags in the autoregressive dynamics are not simply measures of
  delayed density dependence but also depend on life-history parameters. The
  theory indicates that the total density dependence in a life history, D,
  should be defined as the negative elasticity of population growth rate per
  generation with respect to change in population size, , where l is the
  asymptotic multiplicative growth T D p ln l/ ln N rate per year, T is the
  generation time, and N is adult population size. The total density dependence
  in the life history, D, can be estimated from the sum of the autoregression
  coefficients. We estimate D in populations of seven vertebrate species for
  which life-history studies and unusually long time series of complete
  population$15.00 All rights reserved. censuses are available. Estimates of D
  were statistically significant and large, on the order of 1 or higher,
  indicating strong density dependence in five of the seven species. We also
  show that life history can explain the qualitative features of population
  autocorrelation functions and power spectra and observations of increasing
  empirical variance in population size with increasing length of time series.%

    Abundances of 12 laboratory populations of the greenbottle blowfly (Lucilia
  sericata) were recorded every two days for 776 d, with separate counts for
  larvae, pupae, and adults. Half of the populations were exposed to sublethal
  dosages of the toxic compound cadmium acetate; the remaining populations were
  considered controls. Initial density was low for half of the populations in
  each group, and high for the other half. In all populations, the adult
  abundance underwent sustained fluctuations. However, cadmium-exposed
  populations had smaller mean larval and adult densities, and fluctuations in
  adult abundance were less regular than for controls. Data from the first and
  the second half of the experimental period were analyzed separately in order
  to assess the effects of possible long-term changes in the dynamics on the
  estimates. Nonparametric (generalized) additive modeling (GAM) was used to
  investigate time series dynamics and, in particular, to explore the
  density-independent components and the structure of the density-dependent
  components of the system. Overall, cadmium populations had larger
  larva-to-adult survival rate and smaller adult survival rate than control
  populations, and for the second half of the experimental period the
  reproductive rate was smaller for cadmium populations than for control
  populations. Estimation of the density-dependent components suggested that
  survival from larva to adult depended nonlinearly on larval density and that
  increased larval density had a positive effect on larval survival at low
  densities. Furthermore, cadmium generally decreased vital rates. However, the
  analysis suggested that most of the observed differences in dynamical
  behavior between control and cadmium populations are related to differences
  in the density-independent components of the demographic rates, rather than
  differences in the density-dependent structure.%

    We develop a numerical method to reconstruct systems of ordinary

  knowledge of the underlying ODEs using sparse basis learning and sparse
  function reconstruction. We show that employing sparse representations
  provides more accurate ODE reconstruction compared to least-squares
  reconstruction techniques for a given amount of time series data. We test and
  validate the ODE reconstruction method on known 1D, 2D, and 3D systems of
  ODEs. The 1D system possesses two stable fixed points; the 2D system
  possesses an oscillatory fixed point with closed orbits; and the 3D system
  displays chaotic dynamics on a strange attractor. We determine the amount of
  data required to achieve an error in the reconstructed functions to less than
  $0.1\%$. For the reconstructed 1D and 2D systems, we are able to match the
  trajectories from the original ODEs even at long times. For the 3D system
  with chaotic dynamics, as expected, the trajectories from the original and
  reconstructed systems do not match at long times, but the reconstructed and
  original models possess similar Lyapunov exponents. Now that we have
  validated this ODE reconstruction method on known models, it can be employed
  in future studies to identify new systems of ODEs using time series data from

    Our knowledge about population-level effects of abiotic stressors is
  limited, largely due to lack of appropriate time-series data. To analyse
  interactions between an abiotic stressor and density-dependent processes, we
  used experimental time-series data for stage-structured populations (the
  blowfly Lucilia sericata) exposed to the toxicant cadmium through 20
  generations. Resource limitation results in competition both in the larval
  and the adult stages. The toxicant has only negative effects at the organism
  level, but nevertheless, there were positive population-level effects. These
  are necessarily indirect, and indicate overcompensatory density-dependent
  responses. A non-parametric model (generalized additive model) was used to
  investigate the density-dependent structures of the demographic rates,
  without making assumptions about the functional forms. The estimated
  structures were used to develop a parametric model, with which we analysed
  effects of the toxicant on density-dependent and density-independent
  components of the stage-specific demographic rates. The parameter estimates
  identified both synergistic and antagonistic density-toxicant interactions.
  It is noteworthy that the synergistic interaction occurred together with a
  net positive effect of the toxicant. Hence, the effects of such interactions
  should be considered together with the capacity for compensatory responses.
  The combination of the two modelling approaches provided new insight into
  mechanisms for compensatory responses to abiotic stressors. © 2005 The Royal

    1. In this review, we focus on how males can affect the population dynamics
  of ungu-lates (i) by being a component of population density (and thereby
  affecting interpretation of log-linear models), and (ii) by considering the
  mechanisms by which males can actively affect the demographic rates of
  females. 2. We argue that the choice of measure of density is important, and
  that the inclusion or exclusion of males into models can influence results.
  For example, we demonstrate that if the dynamics of a population can be
  described with a first-order auto-regressive process in a log-linear
  framework, the asymmetry between the effects of females on the male dynamics
  and vice versa can introduce a second order process, much in the same way
  that the interaction between disease and host or predator and prey can. It
  would be useful for researchers with sufficient data to explore the affects
  of using different density measures. 3. In general, even in harvested
  populations with highly skewed sex ratios, males are usually able to
  fertilize all females, though detailed studies document a lower proportion of
  younger females breeding when sex ratios are heavily female biased. It is
  well documented that the presence of males can induce oestrus in females, and
  that male age may also be a factor. In populations with both a skewed sex
  ratio and a young male age structure, calving is delayed and less
  synchronous. We identify several mechanisms that may be responsible for this.
  4. Delayed calving may lower summer survival and autumn masses, which may
  lead to higher winter mortality. If females are born light, they may require
  another year of growth before they start reproducing. Delayed calving can
  reduce future fertility of the mother. As the proportion of calves predated
  during the first few weeks of life is often very high, calving synchrony may
  also be an important strategy to lower predation rates. 5. We argue that the
  effects of males on population dynamics of ungulates are likely to be
  non-trivial, and that their potential effects should not be ignored. The
  mechanisms we discuss may be important-though much more research is required
  before we can demonstrate they are.%

    The assessment of relative model performance using information criteria
  like AIC and BIC has become routine among functional-response studies,
  reflecting trends in the broader ecological literature. Such information
  criteria allow comparison across diverse models because they penalize each
  model's fit by its parametric complexity—in terms of their number of free
  parameters—which allows simpler models to outperform similarly fitting
  models of higher parametric complexity. However, criteria like AIC and BIC do
  not consider an additional form of model complexity, referred to as geometric
  complexity, which relates specifically to the mathematical form of the model.
  Models of equivalent parametric complexity can differ in their geometric
  complexity and thereby in their ability to flexibly fit data. Here we use the
  Fisher Information Approximation to compare, explain, and contextualize how
  geometric complexity varies across a large compilation of single-prey
  functional-response models—including prey-, ratio-, and predator-dependent
  formulations—reflecting varying apparent degrees and forms of
  non-linearity. Because a model's geometric complexity varies with the data's
  underlying experimental design, we also sought to determine which designs are
  best at leveling the playing field among functional-response models. Our
  analyses illustrate (1) the large differences in geometric complexity that
  exist among functional-response models, (2) there is no experimental design
  that can minimize these differences across all models, and (3) even the
  qualitative nature by which some models are more or less flexible than others
  is reversed by changes in experimental design. Failure to appreciate model
  flexibility in the empirical evaluation of functional-response models may
  therefore lead to biased inferences for predator–prey ecology, particularly
  at low experimental sample sizes where its impact is strongest. We conclude
  by discussing the statistical and epistemological challenges that model
  flexibility poses for the study of functional responses as it relates to the
  attainment of biological truth and predictive ability.%

    The estimation of the mortality rate function for a stage-structured
  population is obtained starting from time-series field data on the abundance
  of the species. The method is based on the formulation of the mortality as a
  combination of cubic splines and it is applied to the case of Lobesia
  botrana, the main pest in the European vineyards, with data collected in a
  location in the North of Italy. Mortality estimates are based on 3 years of
  data and are used to obtain the dynamics for two different years. These
  dynamics give a satisfactory fit of the phenology of the pest. The method
  presented allows to obtain more flexible shape for the mortality rate
  functions compared with previously methods applied for the same pest.%

    Understanding the uncertainty of a neural network's (NN) predictions is
  essential for many purposes. The Bayesian framework provides a principled
  approach to this, however applying it to NNs is challenging due to large
  numbers of parameters and data. Ensembling NNs provides an easily
  implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it
  has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one
  modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate
  Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a
  distribution which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of
  the procedure in a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is
  centred correctly but tends to have an underestimated marginal variance, and
  overestimated correlation. However, two conditions can lead to exact
  recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially present in NNs.
  Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard
  ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.%

    DiffEqFlux.jl is a library for fusing neural networks and differential

  of data science and discuss the complementary nature between machine learning
  models and differential equations. We demonstrate the ability to incorporate
  DifferentialEquations.jl-defined differential equation problems into a
  Flux-defined neural network, and vice versa. The advantages of being able to
  use the entire DifferentialEquations.jl suite for this purpose is
  demonstrated by counter examples where simple integration strategies fail,
  but the sophisticated integration strategies provided by the
  DifferentialEquations.jl library succeed. This is followed by a demonstration
  of delay differential equations and stochastic differential equations inside
  of neural networks. We show high-level functionality for defining neural
  ordinary differential equations (neural networks embedded into the
  differential equation) and describe the extra models in the Flux model zoo
  which includes neural stochastic differential equations. We conclude by
  discussing the various adjoint methods used for backpropogation of the
  differential equation solvers. DiffEqFlux.jl is an important contribution to
  the area, as it allows the full weight of the differential equation solvers

    Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are
  highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are
  valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying
  processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and
  experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract
  from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter
  measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones
  delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different
  settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the
  properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary
  considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations.
  In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model
  parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We
  combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model
  with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for
  variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a
  comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that
  features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model
  predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of
  the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the
  Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting
  cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process
  rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We
  detected significant variability among parameters of different time series
  and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a
  source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending
  more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and
  shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by
  simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in
  conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal
  properties in nature.%

  populations; (2) they use only 2 species ; (3) they use a single parametric

  can potentially position yourself by stating that this is close to a

  actually almost identical?<br/>- It seems that the time series come from
  different experiments, so technically not really replicates and differences
  in dynamics and dynamical processes are expected. The origin and differences
  among these time series is unclear and we cannot draw conclusions regarding
  the source of variability in dynamical processes. This is however a very
  interesting stepping stone to jump from.}

  between two species (be it mutualistic, competitive, antagonistic, or
  neutral) may switch to a different class, depending on the biotic and abiotic
  factors within which species are observed. This complexity arising from the
  evidence of context-dependencies has underscored a difficulty in establishing
  a systematic analysis about the extent to which species interactions are
  expected to switch in nature and experiments. Here, we propose an overarching
  theoretical framework, by integrating probabilistic and structural
  approaches, to establish null expectations about switches of interaction
  classes across environmental contexts. This integration provides a systematic
  platform upon which it is possible to establish new hypotheses, clear
  predictions, and quantifiable expectations about the context-dependency of
  species interactions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A central theme in ecological research is to understand how species
  interactions contribute to community dynamics. Species interactions are the
  basis of parametric (model-driven) and nonparametric (model-free) approaches
  in theoretical and empirical work. However, despite their different
  interpretations across these approaches, these measures have occasionally
  been used interchangeably, limiting our opportunity to use their differences
  to gain new insights about ecological systems. Here, we revisit two of the
  most used measures across these approaches: species interactions measured as
  constant direct effects (typically used in parametric approaches) and local
  aggregated effects (typically used in nonparametric approaches). We show two
  fundamental properties of species interactions that cannot be revealed
  without bridging these definitions. First, we show that the local aggregated
  intraspecific effect summarizes all potential pathways through which one
  species impacts itself, which are likely to be negative even without any
  constant direct self-regulation mechanism. This property has implications for
  the long-held debate on how communities can be stabilized when little
  evidence of self-regulation has been found among higher-trophic species.
  Second, we show that a local aggregated interspecific effect between two
  species is correlated with the constant direct interspecific effect if and
  only if the population dynamics do not have any higher-order direct effects.
  This other property provides a rigorous methodology to detect direct
  higher-order effects in the field and experimental data. Overall, our
  findings illustrate a practical route to gain further insights about
  non-equilibrium ecological dynamics and species interactions.%

    Differential equations in general and neural ODEs in particular are an
  essential technique in continuous-time system identification. While many
  deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical
  integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active
  learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering
  require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we
  propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural
  ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling
  uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the
  state space. Our algorithm-distributional gradient matching (DGM)-jointly
  trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via
  minimizing a Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to
  traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our
  approach is faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen
  trajectories, and in the context of neural ODEs, significantly more
  accurate.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Ecological theory suggests that large-scale patterns such as community
  stability can be influenced by changes in interspecific interactions that
  arise from the behavioural and/or physiological responses of individual
  species varying over time. Although this theory has experimental support,
  evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking owing to the challenges of
  tracking rapid changes in interspecific interactions (known to occur on
  timescales much shorter than a generation time) and then identifying the
  effect of such changes on large-scale community dynamics. Here, using tools
  for analysing nonlinear time series and a 12-year-long dataset of fortnightly
  collected observations on a natural marine fish community in Maizuru Bay,
  Japan, we show that short-term changes in interaction networks influence
  overall community dynamics. Among the 15 dominant species, we identify 14
  interspecific interactions to construct a dynamic interaction network. We
  show that the strengths, and even types, of interactions change with time; we
  also develop a time-varying stability measure based on local Lyapunov
  stability for attractor dynamics in non-equilibrium nonlinear systems. We use
  this dynamic stability measure to examine the link between the time-varying
  interaction network and community stability. We find seasonal patterns in
  dynamic stability for this fish community that broadly support expectations
  of current ecological theory. Specifically, the dominance of weak
  interactions and higher species diversity during summer months are associated
  with higher dynamic stability and smaller population fluctuations. We suggest
  that interspecific interactions, community network structure and community
  stability are dynamic properties, and that linking fluctuating interaction
  networks to community-level dynamic properties is key to understanding the
  maintenance of ecological communities in nature.%

    Models are useful when they are compared with data. Whether this comparison
  should be qualitative or quantitative depends on circumstances, but in many
  cases some statistical comparison of model and data is useful and enhances
  objectivity. Unfortunately, ecological dynamic models tend to contain
  assumptions and simplifications that enhance tractability, promote insight,
  but spoil model fit, and this can cause difficulties when adopting a
  statistical approach. Furthermore, the arcane numerical analysis required to
  fit dynamic models reliably presents an impediment to objective model testing
  by fitting. This paper presents methods for formulating and fitting partially
  specified models, which aim to achieve a measure of generality by avoiding
  some of the irrelevant incidental assumptions that are inevitable in more
  traditional approaches. This is done by allowing delay differential equation
  models, difference equation models, and differential equation models to be
  constructed with part of their structure represented by unknown functions,
  while part of the structure may contain conventional model elements that
  contain only unknown parameters. An integrated practical methodology for
  using such models is presented along with several examples, which include use
  of models formulated using delay differential equations, discrete difference
  equations/matrix models, ordinary differential equations, and partial
  differential equations. The methods also allow better estimation from
  ecological data by model fitting, since models can be formulated to include
  fewer unjustified assumptions than would usually be the case if more
  traditional models were used, while still including as much structure as the
  modeler believes can be justified by biological knowledge: model structure
  improves precision, while fewer extraneous assumptions reduce unquantifiable
  bias.%

    So far a considerable number of studies have been carried out on estimating
  parameters and completing imperfect parts of dynamical equations of an
  ecological system from a set of observation data. This paper presents a new
  method for such purposes by using a multi-layer neural network with residual
  minimization training, where an object function composed of a sum of squared
  residuals of supposed governing equations at collocation points and squared
  deviations of the solutions from observation data is minimized. Firstly, we
  applied this method to analysis of "model observation data" produced by
  numerical integration of equations of a predator-prey system. As a result the
  parameters included in the model equations are recovered with considerably
  high accuracy even when artificial random noises are added to the original
  solutions. Then, we applied it successfully to real time-series data of
  protozoan populations. It is concluded that the new method can be effectively
  applied to analyses of time-series data in the field of the ecological
  science. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Trophic relationships, such as those between predator and prey or between
  pathogen and host, are key interactions linking species in ecological food
  webs. The structure of these links and their strengths have major
  consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and
  strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using
  observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show
  that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses
  when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid
  evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations, in
  rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats, show that the predator or
  pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey
  or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly
  linked in these experimental microcosms, but without this knowledge, we would
  infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not
  at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics
  occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring
  defense against attack, and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with
  other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we
  developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the
  phage-bacteria experiments, where bacterial evolution could be tracked.
  Modeling suggests that rapid evolution may also confound experimental
  approaches to measuring interaction strength, but it identifies certain
  experimental designs as being more robust against potential confounding by
  rapid evolution. © 2007 Yoshida et al.%

    Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales1–7 .
  However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological
  dynamics8 are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions8 .
  Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator
  density affects predator–prey (rotifer–algal) cycles in laboratory
  microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our
  system that allows prey evolution9 .We verified the predicted existence of an
  evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against
  consumption, and exam- ined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the
  evolution- ary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures
  (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical
  quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas
  multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cul- tures produced long cycles
  with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted.
  These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter
  predator–prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand
  population oscillations in nature10,11 cannot neglect potential effects from
  ongoing rapid evolution.%

    \field{note}{- Evolutionary response of the prey (i.e. tendency to clump

  Mathematical model (ODE) predicting shifts in population dynamics with
  genetic diversity in prey. (long cycles for diverse preys, short
  lotka-voltera cycles for clonal populations). Phenotype: trade off between
  competitivity and resistance to predation.<br/>- Experimentally tested model
  prediction in microcosm. Manipulated prey genetic variation: population of a
  miture of small predator resistant preys (less competitive) and bigger less
  resistant preys, or clonal of either phenotype. And monitor population
  dynamics. Small phenotype is an evolutionary of the prey to exposure to the
  predator.<br/><br/>3. Results<br/>- Find long cycles in polymorphic
  populations.<br/>- Short cycles in oligomorphic populations.<br/><br/>4.
  Discussion<br/>- Shows importance of phenotypic variation for population
  dynamics.<br/>- Moreover as phenotype is obtained by an evolutionary
  response, and it implies shifts in genetic structure, results implies that
  fast evolutionary response can be a mechanism underlying observed population
  dynamics.<br/>- YET, this is caused by changes in standing genetic variation,
  namely displacement of biomass on phenotypic axis, this is simply selection,
  a very restraint form of evolutionary response.}

    Neural ODEs and i-ResNet are recently proposed methods for enforcing
  invertibility of residual neural models. Having a generic technique for
  constructing invertible models can open new avenues for advances in learning
  systems, but so far the question of whether Neural ODEs and i-ResNets can
  model any continuous invertible function remained unresolved. Here, we show
  that both of these models are limited in their approximation capabilities. We
  then prove that any homeomorphism on a $p$-dimensional Euclidean space can be
  approximated by a Neural ODE operating on a $2p$-dimensional Euclidean space,
  and a similar result for i-ResNets. We conclude by showing that capping a
  Neural ODE or an i-ResNet with a single linear layer is sufficient to turn
  the model into a universal approximator for non-invertible continuous
  functions.%
